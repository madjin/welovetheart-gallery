2470,Generosity&#8217;s Glow,"The image titled &#8220;Generosity&#8217;s Glow&#8221; captures a moment of heartfelt exchange in a customer service setting, perhaps a retail or a food service counter, where the monetary transaction is overshadowed by the emotional transaction taking place. The teller, with a radiant smile, hands over not just the change, but a luminous, heart-shaped light to her customers, symbolizing the warmth and care that infuse her service. The glowing hearts, shared between the teller and her customers, are a poetic representation of the good will and appreciation that can be the hallmark of positive customer interactions. This scene is a celebration of the human element in service industries, a reminder that beyond the goods and the currency, it&#8217;s the kindness and connection that truly enrich the exchange.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/l1.png,1024,1024,1863525,Music,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x0D0C3dBbbB73F7aa3F64e2616e33ccF92c790497
2466,Fiscal Empress,"The image depicts a theatrical scene where a solitary woman stands elevated on a platform, her attire a magnificent dress fashioned from dollar bills, with a dramatic pose that suggests both power and poise. She is encircled by a crowd of onlookers, all uniformly dressed in suits patterned with a monochromatic currency design, their faces tilted upwards in unified admiration. The composition is illuminated by a spotlight that shines down from above, highlighting the woman as the focal point and creating an almost religious aura around her. This tableau seems to critique the glorification of wealth in modern society, presenting the woman as an icon of financial influence and success, while the crowd represents the masses who aspire or are in thrall to such economic stature. The image is rich in metaphor, drawing a parallel between money and monarchy, and invites reflection on the societal elevation of financial prosperity to a status of reverence.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/m3.png,1024,1024,1418347,Music,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0xC96c180dD874466E28C0C9B0716602Cc58B13Ab8

2276,Process,"&#8220;Harmonizing Past Dreams with Present Realities: A Journey of Artistic Evolution&#8221;\nThe melodies that accompanied me through my high school years have left an enduring imprint on my artistic sensibilities. Back then, I aspired to carve my path as a guitarist in a punk rock band, fueled by the passion for creating evocative tunes. However, life&#8217;s trajectory took an unexpected turn, leading me to my current role as a graphic designer &#8211; a pivot that has been both surprising and fulfilling.\nMusical Roots and Artistic Aspirations:\nThe songs that resonated with me during those formative years planted the seeds of artistic expression. The dream of contributing to a punk rock ensemble was a driving force, a vision that, despite taking a backseat, continues to inspire my creative journey.\nFrom Dreams to Design:\nIn pursuit of my passion for visual aesthetics, I embarked on a project that seamlessly merged my love for music and graphic design. Enlisting the help of a friend to model for the project, her commitment to the vision proved instrumental in translating ideas into visual reality.\nThe Artistic Process:\nMy creative process extended beyond mere inspiration, involving meticulous research and exploration. Extensive internet searches led me to discover a template that resonated with my vision, forming the foundation for the design that would come to life.\nCraftsmanship with Adobe Photoshop:\nThe execution of this project was a testament to my commitment to excellence. Leveraging the sophisticated capabilities of Adobe Photoshop, I meticulously brought the design to fruition. Every detail, from composition to color, was carefully considered to ensure a harmonious blend of creativity and precision.\nEvolution in Artistry:\nWhile the trajectory of my career may have deviated from the initial dream of a punk rock guitarist, the evolution into a graphic designer has been a journey rich with unexpected discoveries. Each project, like this one, serves as a canvas for the fusion of artistic passion and professional skill.\nGratitude for the Creative Journey:\nIn retrospect, I am grateful for the convergence of musical roots and graphic design. It&#8217;s a testament to the unpredictable yet enriching nature of artistic evolution, where dreams may transform but the essence of creativity remains a constant driving force.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/punk.jpg,2000,2000,6357813,Music,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x6d4bf920a074901781601e4bb888a37e1d68f011/1

Let them realize the wrongdoing they have done to the forest.\nKiranos&#8217;s story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of human greed and the importance of respecting nature.

In this piece, Django addresses the enigmatic topic of &#8220;chemtrails&#8221;, generating a visual narrative that invites reflection on the existence or not of these phenomena and the dark conjecture that surrounds them.\nThe work is presented in intense tones of black and white, creating a play of light and shadow that symbolizes the duality of the chemtrails theory. The white lines, evoking trails in the sky, intertwine with dark areas, representing the uncertainty and mystery surrounding this conspiracy theory.\nDjango uses symmetry and meticulous composition to convey a sense of order and control, elements that contrast with the chaotic nature of chemtrails theories. Each digital stroke seems to tell a story, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in speculation and questioning.\nThe intricate details within the work suggest a deep exploration of the controversy surrounding chemtrails. Some elements could represent science and research, while others could hint at the shadow of conspiracy. Django plays with ambiguity, letting the viewer&#8217;s interpretation guide the visual experience.\nThe name &#8220;Chemtrails&#8221; resonates with controversy and intrigue, and the work itself becomes a digital canvas where theories and perceptions converge. Through artistic expression, Django invites viewers to question, explore and form their own conclusions about the chemtrails phenomenon and its potential impact on reality.\nIn this work, Django not only creates a piece of digital art, but also raises questions about the power of information, perception, and the intersection between truth and conspiracy. &#8220;Chemtrails&#8221; stands as a mirror in which viewers can confront their own beliefs and reflect on the mysterious fabric that makes up our understanding of the world.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/LINEAS-1-copia-scaled.jpg,1817,2560,1632442,Music,Holograph,https://app.holograph.xyz/collections/0xa8be1e536f9e42901df447241857b73ae027a21f/nfts/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004

Each digital brush stroke appears to capture the very essence of distant galaxies, revealing a palette of cosmic colors that bring to life never-before-conceived floral shapes.\nThe work invites us to reflect on the interconnection between the earthly and the heavenly, between the ephemeral beauty of flowers and the eternity of the cosmos. The choice to be called &#8220;Galaxy Flowers&#8221; is not accidental; It is a reminder that even in the vast and seemingly infinite universe, nature finds amazing ways to manifest itself.\nEach digital petal appears to vibrate with the energy of the stars, and each leaf unfolds like a star map. Intricate textures and meticulous details take viewers on an introspective journey.\nIn &#8220;Galaxy Flowers,&#8221; Django transcends the conventional limitations of digital art, fusing the organic with the cosmic in an ethereal dance. The work is not only visually striking, but also invokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, reminding us of art&#8217;s ability to expand our horizons and connect with the wonders of the universe.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Django-Pint6-copia-scaled.jpg,2560,1814,1065531,Music,Holograph,https://app.holograph.xyz/collections/0xa8be1e536f9e42901df447241857b73ae027a21f/nfts/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
2186,Barbarian Constellation,"&#8220;Barbarian Constellation,&#8221; a visual epic created by the master of the imagination, Django, is a digital work that challenges the boundaries of understanding. In this piece, Django immerses us in a universe where the barbaric is intertwined with the majesty of the constellations, creating a symphony of bright reds and cosmic enigmas.\nThe work is presented as a one-of-a-kind constellation, where the wild and primitive forms of the barbarians mix with celestial geometry. Django uses intricate lines and bold contours to represent the raw energy and indomitable strength of the barbarians.\nThe title, &#8220;Barbarian Constellation&#8221;, plays with the duality between the known and the mysterious. Barbarian figures emerge from the darkness, while stars form patterns that defy any attempt at classification. The constellation becomes a visual tale of the wild and the celestial, where the enigmatic meets the primitive in a cosmic dance.\nThe bright reds that dominate the color palette not only symbolize the ferocity of the barbaric, but also suggest a visceral connection to the essence of existence. Each fiery shade tells a story of passion, struggle and mystery, creating a captivating contrast against the backdrop of cosmic space.\nDjango has woven details into the work that invite thought. Between the lines and the flashes, there are enigmatic clues that suggest untold stories and myths to discover. The narrative of &#8220;Barbarian Constellation&#8221; is constructed through suggestions, leaving room for the viewer&#8217;s personal interpretation and exploration.\nIn this work, Django has managed to fuse the primitive and the celestial, the barbaric and the enigmatic, creating a digital piece that invites viewers to immerse themselves in the controlled chaos of a unique constellation. &#8220;Barbarian Constellation&#8221; stands as a monument to the duality of human nature and the vastness of the cosmos, a visual experience that transcends the limitations of conventional reality.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_7721-scaled.jpg,1836,2560,1443994,Music,Holograph,https://app.holograph.xyz/collections/0xa8be1e536f9e42901df447241857b73ae027a21f/nfts/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003

2164,Vuelo,"&#8220;Vuelo,&#8221; which means &#8220;flight&#8221; in Spanish, depicts a woman dreaming, flying, and existing simultaneously in multiple realms. She is on the other side, momentarily. She travels while she sleeps, and she always stays protected. Vuelo is a key to elevate and fly at any moment, when awake; when dreaming. \nThe painting is 100 x 81 x 3 cm, and I painted it in November 2023. \nThis is an original oil painting, and I created it without a sketch or plan. I simply followed the shapes and the intuition of the canvas. It looks musical, but Vuelo has no sound. Just air. \nThe yellow circle at the bottom shows the full moon, and the smaller red circle symbolizes the sun. The energy of the piece was inspired by the color palette of ancient Egyptian artifacts, and when I was painting, I started thinking about the bodies and fluid shapes of Francis Bacon. I am usually inspired by Pablo Picasso, but this piece Vuelo is something different. Less cubes, more fluidity. This painting is more relaxed than my other pieces, and this painting is not trying to achieve anything. This painting simply wants to fly and explore everything. \nEach layer was painted 4 times with various oil pigments and chemicals, and I also prepared the canvas with handmade gesso before I started painting. \nThis piece is previously unminted and unsold, I am minting it to enter the competition &#8220;We love the art&#8221; by Optimism.\nIt would be a great honor to win the contest and receive support to keep on creating interdimensional sleep-scapes such as Vuelo. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Vuelo-Oil-painting-by-Linnea-Moritz-scaled.jpg,2560,2069,751009,Music,Zora,https://app.holograph.xyz/collections/4da47671-ae59-46da-85b3-f6edf45cd635/nfts/09ba6430-aeea-4d72-b120-ae91516e4d8c

After a year of grinding in the music NFT space attending and hosting Twitter spaces everyday I met all types of incredible artists. Two of which were Wayak and Benny Groove. One late night in a Twitter space Benny sang the iconic chorus and instantly me and Wayak knew we had to make something of this. It was around that time that sound.xyz FINALLY gave me an invite to join the platform and we knew it was the perfect moment. So much of my life and music career it seemed I was the only one that saw my vision and almost everyone else in my life had written me off as psycho.

2080,The &#8220;What If&#8221; Project,"How heavy that art history book felt on the school desks—yet, how it fascinated me. Over time, however, numbers took precedence and, step by step, I found myself stepping into the shoes of a technologist. I never excelled in drawing; I attempted with brushes, leaving an indelible mark on some walls. Yet, when the regret for the lost art began to echo within me, it was technology that reached out, offering me the tools to relive that artistic thrill.\nThe “What If” Project delves into the synergy of human creativity and the capabilities of generative artificial intelligences within the realm of art and painting. It pushes the boundaries of artistic expression and potentially reshapes our understanding of creativity itself.\nThis anthology showcases a collection of digital paintings each one a testament to the fusion of technology and artistry. Crafted with a digital brush, these pieces not only adopt the style of various artistic movements but also embody them, giving life to stories, emotions, and provocations. It&#8217;s an endeavor that invites a reexamination of the classic methods of artistic creation, challenging the established norms and preconceptions of the art-making process.\nThe genesis of each piece begins with an idea and a narrative, brought to life through a continuous prompting fed into the first specialized custom GPT dedicated to the generation of digital paintings: TWIP.\nTWIP extends the GPT base knowledge with more than 5000 pages of specialized artistic and painting books and resources in order to generate painting following the desired artistic direction, taking into account elements such as lighting, tools, color palette, style, and perspective.\nFollowing this initial phase, the artwork undergoes a series of AI-powered enhancements, which include noise reduction and lighting adjustments.\nAfter these refinements, the piece is subjected to the creation of multiple variations, each one then meticulously upscaled, retouched, and post-processed using traditional graphic design software, such as Photoshop.\nThe “What If” Project is more than a story: it is a journey into the past, a personal testament of the author that unravels in an alternate dimension. Here, the author expresses themselves &#8220;as if they had been a painter,&#8221; exploring the potent question of &#8220;What If&#8221;. It is technology that transforms this passion from a regret into a tangible reality. The &#8220;What If&#8221; Project aims to inspire introspection and a willingness to embrace life&#8217;s often overlooked possibilities. We hope that those who engage with our work will see a reflection of themselves within it and feel a spark of desire to express themselves in ways they&#8217;ve always dreamed of. In doing so, they may uncover their own unvoiced &#8216;What Ifs,&#8217; revealing paths not yet taken and dreams waiting to be pursued.\n",null,null,null,null,Music,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/the-what-if-project/overview

2068,Surf Noir Trailer 001 (Animated Short),"Concept:\nIn Surf Noir Trailer 001, an unnamed teen from Nearstalgia Bay dreams of unveiling the mysteries beyond the isolated isles of Surf Noir.\nThis region has been known by many names throughout time such as Tidewater, The Seven Cities, and Hampton Roads, to name a few.\nNow, in the year 2075, the seven major cities, Neptunia, NEON City, Portnova, Hamptonaire, Gulfstream Heights, Aquastrand, and Elysium Point; are now known as The Seven Isles of Surf Noir.\nAs the region succumbed to sea level rise, beaches all but disappeared, and rideable waves along with them and the cities became increasingly isolated from one another as they could not agree on how to collectively handle the impending climate change crisis.\nWhile each city tapped into their unique strength to reach new heights, there is one remaining cultural thread that connects them, future surf.\nAt the core, It was this cultural export that fueled Surf Noir to become a destination of global interest.\nProcess:\n&#8211; MidJourney for image generation\n&#8211; Photoshop for image editing\n&#8211; Pika Labs for image to video generation\n&#8211; Topaz Labs for video upscaling\n&#8211; Eleven Labs for voice over\n&#8211; Davinci Resolve for video editing\n&#8211; Script written by Cam Murdoch\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-9.56.30-AM.png,1314,2638,4879386,Music,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x0fc5a41490d3517af4b16a2d1fee3191630e8b60/1
2064,Look Up,"This track began as a forgotten song idea intertwined with a captivating moment along the St. Lawrence River in Lisbon, NY during the midst of Fall in 2022. Armed with my DJI RS2, BMPCC4K, and iPad, I meticulously planned a panoramic shot encompassing the trees and landscape of my families’ land. Using the wired DJI remote and iPad, I initiated the focus from the nearby grass, gradually pulling focus outwards while panning up, revealing an unseen spectacle. The resulting imagery resembles the fluctuating wave of a stock market pump, elegantly layered in shades of green, with the United States flag flying in the background.\nThe concept here is clear: keeping your head down might obscure immediate beauty. Conversely, looking up can unveil unforeseen wonders and set the stage for embracing life&#8217;s best moments.\nEmploying Davinci Resolve, I employed various effects to experiment and play with the images, each version—Limited, Forever, and Golden Egg—carrying its distinct artwork.\n&#8220;Look Up&#8221; partners with its counterpart collection, &#8220;In The Fall.&#8221; Together, each complete collection offers four audio renditions accompanied by seven unique visual experiences crafted through mirrored imagery—a nod to rehypothecation. Each mirrored edition is limited to just 20 Limited Editions, encapsulating distinct perspectives within each frame.\nThe full length Video is also being released on Zora, along with prior lower quality versions of the video minted on loopring earlier this year.\n",null,null,null,null,Music,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/ryantreynolds/look-up

2051,Women of the World,"In creating this groundbreaking artwork, I harnessed the power of AI, specifically utilizing the capabilities of Chat GPT. My approach involved training an AI program to embody the essence of an extraordinary artist, one that not only creates but also inspires. This AI was meticulously crafted, drawing from a diverse range of disciplines including cinema, photography, 3D modeling, animation, and engineering concepts. The integration of these fields allowed the AI to understand and interpret artistic principles through a multi-faceted lens.\nThe training model was the cornerstone of this process. It enabled me to manipulate and guide the AI&#8217;s creative instincts with simple inputs, thereby shaping the foundational base model from which the final artwork emerged. This methodology was not just about leveraging technology for art creation; it was about merging the precision of programming with the fluidity of artistic expression.\nThe mission behind this artwork extends beyond the mere creation of visually stunning pieces. It is about empowering creators to take control of their destiny in the rapidly evolving intersection of AI and art. This artwork symbolizes the &#8220;Evolution of Women in the World of AI Art,&#8221; representing a harmonious blend of two pivotal concepts into one cohesive collection.\nThis collection is more than just a series of images; it&#8217;s an analogy, a narrative that captures the transformative journey of women and their role in shaping the future of AI-driven art. Each piece in the collection tells a part of this story, reflecting the resilience, grace, and complexity of women through the lens of advanced AI artistry. In essence, this artwork is a testament to the synergy of human creativity and AI innovation, setting a new precedent in the world of digital art.

2044,Fragrant,"Work description; Fragrant embodies my contemporary approach to pointillism. In this piece, I bring my canvas to life with a fully dotted sky, as well as plants and flowers meticulously expressed through the use of dots. Each dot intricately weaves together to form a vibrant botanical scene. The technique of stippling or pointillism isn&#8217;t just a method here; it&#8217;s the language that breathes life into the sky, infusing it with depth and texture. The dots varies in size and hue, they fuse into a tapestry that invites viewers to immerse themselves in the fragrance and essence of this stunning, dotted world.\nProcess: I made “Fragrant” in 2023, it’s a digital painting manually done on a digital software. I started this piece with a semi vague idea of what I wanted the final look to be but I knew what I wanted it to portray. I’m greatly inspired by nature; flowers, trees, birds, the skies, are all common themes that I incorporate into my pieces.\nI use dots and stipples to achieve this. My work involves layering dots of various colors, values and hues till I achieve what I want. I start with the skies because it makes a great background and then I move to the ground, the shrubbery, the flowers. I wanted this piece to smell like a lovely flower garden to give a nostalgic feeling and to simulate a relaxing experience.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9708.jpeg,1223,1235,3052578,Music,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x8ed470786145386a5ecd712d5d220b4ce47086ce/1

2040,South Ronaldsay,"This photo was taken on the South side of the Orkney Islands in the North of Scotland.

This shot in particular is my favourite out of the collection and if successful I will use the grant money to help promote the remaining of the collection along with buying a proper camera to increase the quality of my images.

1843,Volume I,"I created this song as an expression of my devotion to whatever it is i love, and how one day I envision myself on the biggest stage where crowds of people cheer my name, For this I have Faith in\nIn the depths of human existence, where shadows dance and doubts reside, there lies a flickering flame, an ember of resilience known as faith. This faith, not in a divine power or an external force, but in the indomitable spirit that resides within each of us, the unwavering belief in our own capacity to overcome and achieve.\nThroughout the annals of history, we find countless tales of individuals who defied the odds, who dared to dream amidst adversity, and emerged triumphant, their faith in themselves serving as their guiding beacon. Joan of Arc, a peasant girl from a remote village, heeded the call of her inner voice, leading armies to victory, her unwavering faith in her mission fueling her courage.\nIn the literary realm, Jane Eyre, a young orphan confined to the oppressive walls of Thornfield Hall, refused to relinquish her dreams, her faith in her own worth propelling her towards self-discovery and love. And who can forget the words of Victor Hugo&#8217;s Jean Valjean, a man burdened by his past, who found redemption and purpose, his faith in humanity rekindled through acts of compassion.\nThe philosophers, too, have echoed this sentiment. Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American transcendentalist, eloquently captured the essence of self-belief when he declared, &#8220;Do not wait for the conditions to be perfect. Start now. With every step, you take, you will get closer to your goal.&#8221;\nAnd the renowned poet Maya Angelou, in her profound poem &#8220;Still I Rise,&#8221; epitomized the unwavering spirit of faith, declaring, &#8220;You may shoot me with your words, you may cut me with your eyes, you may kill me with your hatefulness, but still, like air, I&#8217;ll rise.&#8221;\nFaith in oneself is not a blind leap into the unknown; it is a conscious decision, a deliberate act of choosing to believe in our own strength, our own potential, and our own inherent worth. It is the fuel that ignites our passions, the compass that guides our journey, and the anchor that keeps us grounded amidst life&#8217;s storms.\nFaith in oneself is not a guarantee of success, but it is the foundation upon which our aspirations are built. It is the unwavering belief in our ability to learn, to grow, to adapt, and to overcome, that empowers us to rise from the ashes of failure and pursue our dreams with unwavering determination.\nSo, let us cultivate this inner flame, this beacon of self-belief, and let its light illuminate our path, guiding us towards a future where we embrace our limitless possibilities and achieve the extraordinary. Let us have faith in ourselves, for within us lies the power to transform our dreams into reality.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6ec31b6aeddac1d0f641b320d143e6f3_1200_80.png,1600,1600,388004,Music,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/noculture/faith?referral_source=link

1825,Mask of the Man with the Platinum Nose,"Thank you for reviewing my submission.\nMy artwork is revival of a previous piece of mine made in 2020 titled &#8220;Mask of the Man with the Golden Nose&#8221;.

You can access this work on SuperRare: https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/mask-of-the-man-with-the-golden-nose-7246\nThe work was made as homage to my friend at the time Alotta Money, who was an amazing human being and one of the most helpful people I have ever encountered in the cryptoart space. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2022 and things never felt the same after.\nEarlier this year, I had the idea to revisit this work and try to reimagine it as a proper memorial to my late friend, and so &#8220;The Mask of the Man with the Platinum Nose&#8221; was created through the same kinds of earlier processes.\nThis is a human creation with some help from AI, but not a AI artwork captured directly from a tool. I created this artwork through a combination of tools, predominately focused on vector and raster graphics (i.e. Creative Suite) with the inclusion of elements from local AI models which I run in my studio and tune by hand. This work *was not* simply created with an AI tool like MidJourney or DALL-E.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/motmwpn-feature.png,1024,1024,1245531,Music,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x6c3ca85b3286a1aaeae70573a5a34dd33085d4cf/1

1737,I just called to say ILY,"I just called to say ILY is a series I started when joining zeroone.art.\n https://zeroone.art/profile/ijustcalledtosayily\nThe introduction says &#8216;Le téléphone pleure: A conversation with Midjourney about love, longing, and nostalgia.&#8217; While the second sentence doesn&#8217;t need much explanation, the first sentence might sound a bit peculiar to those unfamiliar with the French singer Claude François and his hit song &#8216;Tears on the Telephone&#8217; English version from 1974.\nThe series portrays women of all kinds, calling a loved one on the telephone. However, this particular artwork differs from the rest of the series because I aimed for something a little more pop and candy-like, also more gender-fluid, and surreal enough to resonate with anyone, at least at their rainbow core.\nMy work was done on Midjourney, starting with a prompt that created the face of the lady in the background. I built up from there, zooming out and editing tiny details, touch by touch, to end up with the picture you see, which is exactly what I wanted—without knowing it.

1735,Nova On Everything,"I made this piece while experimenting with the MVP for a daily creative game I was working on called the Creative Cup. It&#8217;s a daily contest where the group gets a prompt and can submit any kind of digital content. Everyone in the group votes on their favorites and the winner gets an NFT and a lifetime of glory. It&#8217;s reminiscent of an exercise I used to do daily in creative writing class where you get a prompt and write in your journal about anything related to it for 15 minutes to get your creativity flowing. I&#8217;ve had the idea to give it some crypto elements for a while now, but wasn&#8217;t sure how to make it, so to start, I made a microsite which you can find here: https://noahnewfield.wixsite.com/creativecup, and started a Telegram group with some friends to facilitate the contest. Ultimately I think it would go great with a Nouns style growth mechanism. This day&#8217;s prompt was &#8220;Your favorite meal of the day&#8221;. The piece is representative of me getting back to creating things for myself, regardless of how &#8220;good&#8221; anyone else thinks they are.

1725,Okay Okay Music NFT,"The song I have shared ‘Okay Okay’ captures much of what on-chain music culture is about for me. This song only exists on Sound, keeping it exclusive for collectors. It uses samples from 2 on-chain sample packs from Kits.io and includes a 0xSplits contract to a DAO community which previously supported my NFTs to put ETH back into the treasury.\nOkay Okay was written in my home studio using Ableton 11 and also uses hardware synthesizer (Roland JX-03) to create the bass. With a combination of software and hardware, it brings interesting textures to the track which gives more of a human element to it since the bass was recorded live, tweaking the cut off frequency on the filter. The song is fully mixed and mastered by myself and I take a lot of pride in this. This was one of those tracks that I wrote and instantly worked, each decision flowing into the other and before I knew it I had a really nice vibe going. It felt right and knew I was onto something.\nI also have a passion for Photography and the cover art are photos that I’ve taken at an old abandoned super club in Ibiza. There are 3 artwork versions, one for the lower price point forever edition, one for the limited edition NFT and a final photo for the golden egg. All 3 images are graffiti based as this fits in with my brand and helps me tell a story of the music. The forever edition has a hole in the wall and since it’s a circular image which can last forever, matches this type of edition. The limited edition face on the pillar is an interesting concept for me and the most engaging photo, that’s why I selected it for the limited edition and the monkey for the golden egg as I wanted to keep this image rare. \nTo view all 3 artworks please see Google Drive link here &#8211; https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ix7Q4ReMUfGolZ2W8U9oJaU9hrnhG9Fr?usp=sharing\nAll in all, this song has been created by me from the concept to the final artwork and distribution. I hope you like the song and will consider this for an award. This was released on 1st November on OP network and although this competition was launched a week later I couldn’t see anything in the T&amp;C’s that this would discount my submission and hope it is acceptable for me to submit this song.\nThanks for taking the time to listen and read my submission.\nKind regards,\nDuncan.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-Limited-Edition.png,2000,2000,7342017,Music,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/acutek/okay-okay

1619,Optimistic Me,"The inspiration for this artwork comes from a foreign poem written in Chinese. The poem, translated by me, is as follows (may not be the perfect translation):\nTwo drops of tears\nFall upon my shoulder,\nOne is the scorching fire,\nThe other, a transparent cloud.\nThis poem depicts the conflict of emotions and the inner turmoil. The two drops of tears symbolize, in my opinion, two different emotions. One teardrop is the scorching fire, representing passion and anger, while the other is a transparent cloud, symbolizing calmness, clarity, and serenity. This can be seen as the poet&#8217;s exploration of inner conflict, attempting to balance or understand these two contrasting emotions. It resonated with me deeply. As you can see in my artwork, to pay homage to optimism, I have redone the eyes with &#8220;OP.&#8221; It shows how I am still optimistic even if life is hard. I hope you enjoy it. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fixed-u.jpg,1457,1464,2617250,Music,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x27325b6D779849106187fC95A8A63C931C0B88A1

In this case, I took the basic concept of Mucha&#8217;s seasons but represented it in a more surrealistic style that I believe fits better with art generated by artificial intelligence (I think surrealism/psychedelic art/fractal art is a very strong point of AI-generated art).

The central focus, a glowing emblem that echoes the fervor of digital tokens, dominates the scene—representing both the allure and the peril of these new digital frontiers.\nKhalep&#8217;s work is saturated with vibrant neon lights and pulsating energy, encapsulating the manic enthusiasm that drives the cryptocurrency craze. In this digital den, paper money and electronic wallets are eagerly surrendered to the glowing &#8216;OP&#8217; icon—a metaphor for the Optimism token, a beacon of the unyielding faith in the digital economy.\n&#8220;Digital Frenzy&#8221; is more than a painting; it&#8217;s a digital mosaic rich with symbolism and layered meanings. It captures the zeitgeist of an era where financial instruments and digital innovations merge into an intricate dance of risk and reward. Khalep&#8217;s creation is a mirror for the viewer, reflecting the seductive chaos of our times through a lens that is as captivating as it is cautionary.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/хомяки.png,null,null,null,Music,Mint.fun,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x0fc8219e45b97572d2d312b139f6829df3231d9a

The artist begins by meticulously hand-painting a ray, imbuing it with the fluidity and grace inherent to this sea creature. The painting, vibrant with motion and life, is then presented to ChatGPT, sparking a conversation about perception. ChatGPT&#8217;s response, reflective of its understanding, is used as a foundation for a new creation through DALL-E 3, which interprets the text description and brings forth an image. The resulting GIF oscillates between the original hand-painted ray and the AI-generated interpretation, interspersed with snippets of the interaction between the artist and AI. This visual story not only showcases the final artworks but also peels back the layers of their creation, offering a glimpse into the process that is at once artistic, technical, and deeply personal.

1163,Everything on my mind,"Over the seas and across the mountains I travel. Setting course for the stars; a dreamy odyssey. I pose my mind to wander, days unending across a universe not made not by hands. The eyes they say, is the window that leads to the soul. Mine is like an escape vacuum beaming light through the milky way that sits right at the center of my being. Full to the brim, I feel my guts. I have become a jar of extravagant zest, causing everything on my path to keep still as I juggle through a pile of cosplay. I made a truce with myself never to clip my own wings. I finally found my way. Anything I want, I can be. I only need to want it bad enough.\nThis piece reminds its viewers that their dreams and desires are so powerful , they posses the ability to take them as far as they want to go. They only must truly want it and be ready to pay the price to get there.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EVERYTHING-ON-MY-MIND-scaled.jpg,2560,2048,957390,Music,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0x26c5d1e6d5be58e4a5c042361daee1eefc38414f/3

1150,Fade,"Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6gPvR7Jw9rIG30cz89T9CC\nHave you ever wondered what your Life would look like if you went contrary to the established norms and paths of society and went with the Intelligent Guidance of your Instinct and Heart instead? Yeah, me too…\nThe date was April 2022 and I had been terminated by my employer from a seemingly successful career of 9 years. My wife was pregnant and due with our first child in a month, I was 4 months into having started a new (Inspired) business and investment path based on Web3 technologies with my brother and close friends, and now faced with a fork in the road: Two roads diverged in a Yellow Wood as Brother Frost tells us…\nWould I acquiesce to the previous pull of what had been largely unfulfilling “9-5” indentured-servitude, or take a risk and continue to forge a new path of entrepreneurship and freedom? The choice for me, after thirty years, was very clear. You see, as many of you likely have, I too had watched my Elders work their best years away for other people and companies based on the promise of better financial days, only for them to never materialize. Like Jim Carey learning from his Father’s struggles: I can fail at what I don’t want, and Thank God I did &#8211; So I might as well go after what I do want, right? Right! Sound familiar? Then this album will sound familiar to you! \nAfter dropping two albums back to back in 2022 with the fam @beatsbyraymusic and @YoungBaridMusic, I felt a musical creativity and inspiration that I hadn’t experienced in quite some time &#8211; since a hiatus dating back to 2011. Locking in on 2023, what originally started as a goal that I set for myself and team this year to drop at minimum 1 thing a month to traditional streaming and Web3 platforms, ended up turning into this Magnum Opus!\nI was blessed to link up with the brother @producedbyaxel_ early in the year and he blessed me by linking me with @rjcproducer and @pstatusbeats who also smashed production and mixing on the Album! Eternally grateful for them and helping this OKC kid live out his Dream and Vision!\nAbout 2-3 months into recording new songs, on the morning of April 29th, 2023, I was met with an intuition upon pondering the sequencing of the tracks for an “Album” &#8211; I was only 9 songs in at this point and thought Track 9, “South”, would close the show. The Intuition proved to be invaluable, revealing that with the proper sequencing, the Album served as a thesis for my culmination of Life’s Influences, Inspirations, and Studies into the Metaphysic and Esoteric &#8211; Numerology, Tarot, Myth, and More! After more Intuitions, the 9 tracks turned into 11, and the “Music” (using this term loosely) portion of the Album was complete! 1 through 11, Magus through Force/Justice/Lust! The Album simultaneously serves as a reflection on the Pop-Cultural and Historical Influences on my Life and their literal and metaphoric relation to the mystery and unfolding of my Journey! I’m at my most vulnerable Self(s) on this album, therapeutically telling raw stories from my life, albeit often hidden behind cryptic metaphor! The Cover Artwork for the Songs comes from photos that my Mother, who passed on in 2019, took of me at sites around Rome, Italy while visiting family in Christmastime of 1997!\nThe product of an Italian Mother and American Born and Educated Muslim Father, the Music reflects the Variety of my upbringing and City, OKC, that Inspired it! I was never “black” enough for the “black crowd”, certainly not “white” enough for the “white folks”, I wandered the “Middle Path”. Too “nerdy” for the “jocks”, too “street” for the “academics”, I was always accepted by and flocked to the Outcasts &#8211; This is also reflected in the Music, and Like will Resonate with Like. All praise is due to the Most High God for this Album and the circumstances surrounding it, for this Being of meager Mind and Body of Flesh to stay Alive, Motivated, Inspired, and Well Enough off with opportunities at this Age to be able to Produce It has been no easy feat &#8211; Art is it’s Own Reward in Itself! We are our own worst enemies and fear (false evidence appearing real) is the only thing stopping us from Living the Life we want!\nI invite you to take a Journey with me through the City that birthed “little vibe” and killed “Heru”. 1 year from the release of my previous “SS1 (Deluxe)” Album, and on the Day of the Full Moon and Lunar Eclipse that ends the Eclipse Axis/Cycle dating back to November 2021 &#8211; when my brother @beatsbyraymusic and I first got together and started masterminding this @Web3Studios creative studio and entrepreneurship Life… What happens next…? “Okay, See!”\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/okayseecoverbright.png,1000,1424,1392518,Music,Sound.xyz,https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x551070a98c0125216d90bb865129d035d87424cb/1/

On their screen-faces are strange images &#8211; drawings of the &#8216;Pizza Time&#8217; family of Blitmap. The original &#8216;Pizza Time,&#8217; made by varley for the Blitmap collection, &#8216;Boomer,&#8217; made by myself for the first generation of Blitkin, and &#8216;Brooder Frog,&#8217; made by Snack for the second and most recent generation of Blitkin.

Recorded over 2 days in the spring of 2014, with some incredible Italian jazz musicians. \nRecording and releasing this album was a milestone moment in my artistic development. A journey that spanned continents, cultures, and emotions.\nAt that point in time I had graduated from the &#8220;G. Rossini Conservatory of Music&#8221; and traveled through most of Europe and Australia, meeting hundreds of incredible musicians, busking on the beautiful streets of Sydney, London, Paris, Rome, etc.\nI also played each and every gig I could find, with all kinds of bands, musicians and DJs. Little by little expanding my musical horizons, acquiring knowledge, feeling and taste. \nMy journey then took me to Berlin, where I refined my jazz chops.\nI played hundreds of shows around the world with my quartet and supporting other amazing musicians. \nThen, in 2020, when live music went away, I took that as an opportunity to search for new avenues to release and monetize my music. I found an answer in blockchain technology.\nWith no limitations imposed by traditional standards, I let my creativity run wild.\nI released my first album on Ethereum in March 2021, &#8216;Nifty Sax Genesis&#8217;, followed in September 2021 by &#8216;Spheres&#8217;, which was a ground-breaking success. \nMy success inspired me to co-found Nifty Music, a music NFT incubator helping fellow artists create their own successful projects.\nNifty Music projects collectively generated over $1 million to-date for our independent artists and their communities.\nAnd here we are now at the present moment, with yet another important milestone, the first music NFT I release to include music from my back catalog.\n&#8212;\nPersonnel: \nTenor Sax – Milo Lombardi\nTrumpet – Giacomo Uncini\nPiano – Mauro Gubbiotti\nGuitar – Diego Donati\nDouble Bass – Manuele Montanari\nDrums – Marco Frattini\nVocals – Rossella Cappadone\nComposed and Arranged by Milo Lombardi\nRecorded at Lunik Studio\nRecorded and Mixed By Davide &#8216;Red&#8217; Battistelli\nMastered By Luca Marzi\nGraphic Design – Marco Scalon\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Time-is-Amazing-NFT-cover-golden-egg.jpg,1400,1400,540109,Music,Sound.xyz,https://opensea.io/collection/the-garden-art

719,Losing My Head,"&#8220;Losing My Head&#8221; is a captivating acrylic painting on stretched canvas that delves into the complexity of human emotions and identity. The focal point of the piece is a man whose head becomes a canvas of shifting faces, each with closed eyes, except for the piercing gaze of the central pair. This dynamic portrayal suggests a kaleidoscope of emotions and the ever-changing nature of our inner selves.\nThe decision to leave the bottom of the painting undone adds an intriguing element, inviting viewers to contemplate the unfinished aspects of life, emotions, or the self. It sparks curiosity and encourages interpretation, leaving room for personal reflection on the incomplete and evolving nature of our own stories.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Losing-My-Head-scaled.jpg,2560,2048,1260127,Music,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0x23f165a27a66915c35c7b3469770880e7eb18129/84

I also wanted to explore the concept of times and seasons. This came together beautifully for me. For starters, the protagonist is in my usual style, the silhouette of a (black) person. However, the protagonist is my first in a mask inspired by a traditional head dress, rather than just a face mask. I then further played with the concept of time by creating windows from different periods: Day, Dusk, Night.\nAfter illustrating and colouring in the piece, I then move my layers into photoshop to tweak and adjust textures and effects to tie my story together completely. \nThe end result of these thoughts, concepts and processes is seasons. Seasons is a reminder that hard work is worth it, there are times and seasons for everything and you must live through these. Also, from the centered protagonist who is slightly bigger than the window frame, it is a reminder that when it is your season, you will stand out.

535,Liberation,"&#8220;Liberation&#8221; refers to the act of setting someone or something free from oppressive or restrictive conditions. It is a concept often associated with social, political, or personal freedom. Liberation can take various forms, including:\nPolitical Liberation: This involves the overthrow of oppressive governments or regimes to establish a more democratic or just system. Examples include the liberation movements in various countries throughout history, such as the American Revolution, the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, or the collapse of the Berlin Wall, which marked the end of the Cold War.\nSocial Liberation: Social liberation is about breaking free from societal norms, prejudices, and discrimination. It often focuses on issues like gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial justice. Movements like the Civil Rights Movement in the United States or the push for marriage equality are examples of social liberation movements.\nPersonal Liberation: This is about individuals breaking free from personal limitations or constraints, often related to self-discovery, personal growth, or overcoming obstacles. Personal liberation can be a deeply internal and psychological process, such as overcoming addiction, healing from trauma, or finding one&#8217;s true identity and purpose.\nSpiritual Liberation: Spiritual liberation involves freeing oneself from spiritual or religious constraints or dogma. It often involves seeking a deeper understanding of one&#8217;s beliefs, spirituality, or connection to a higher power.\nEconomic Liberation: Economic liberation aims to reduce economic disparities and provide opportunities for economic self-sufficiency. It often involves efforts to alleviate poverty, promote entrepreneurship, or address income inequality.\nLiberation movements and ideas have played a significant role in shaping the course of history and continue to be relevant in contemporary society. The specific context and goals of liberation can vary widely, but the underlying theme is the pursuit of greater freedom and justice for individuals and communities&#8230;\n-Daystar\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/liberation.jpg,991,770,179619,Music,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/111461594538215015538294286305714141653742515054463398405558684694892565757957

455,Number 7,"What&#8217;s a (natural) number? What does it look like?\nNot a number&#8217;s symbol, like 3, III, ٣ or Γ. Not an object with a numeric property (&#8220;squares have 4 sides&#8221;).\nIn 1923, John von Neumann proposed a set-theoretic construction of natural numbers: We can start with the empty set, and then define the next number as the set containing all previous numbers:\n0 = {}\n1 = { {} }\n2 = {0, 1} = { {}, {{}} },\n3 = {0, 1, 2} = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} } }\nAnd so on.\nNumber7 is a creative interpretation of the number 7, based on von Neumann&#8217;s construction of natural numbers. Each circle represents a set. Empty circles are empty sets. \nThink of the artwork as 7&#8217;s blueprint: An elegant, simple and easy to understand construction with fractal properties.\nThis work is part of a series of works that try to speak about a concept very common in modern mathematics and quantum physics: Most things around us are &#8220;built&#8221; of &#8220;empty&#8221; (empty space, empty sets).

373,Daughter,"In the last few years many of my friends and family have had children and as I’ve watched them begin to grow up I’ve been thinking a lot about humanity&#8217;s impact on the world and what will be left for their generation. I’m not optimistic about governments and large corporations prioritising the environmental threat before it’s too late. I feel very uncertain about the future, too uncertain to have children of my own.\nI came up with this concept of writing a song to my imaginary daughter &#8211; if I had the opportunity to speak to her now, what would I say? I thought about her getting to adulthood and living on an uninhabitable planet. I would want to explain to her that I thought it was best not to bring her into the world, to protect her from all that. I guess it’s a sort of apology to her really. I hope she would understand and forgive me.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4095021D-CA58-4880-9AB4-A2AAEF65D7BD-scaled.jpeg,2560,2560,1644086,Music,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/darkstates/daughter?referral_source=link

304,Space Chill (WPAA TV Session),"Artist statement:\n“For 10+ years now I&#8217;ve focused on the sax/bass/drums trio format. For much of that time I’ve been in love with the concept that you could compose basslines that kind of give a silhouette of harmony without explicitly defining it, especially if you leave the thirds and fourths out, and allow the melody to &#8220;choose the harmony&#8221;, letting it float around wherever it wants to lean. This song is that concept in action, I wrote this bassline &#8211; jumping between F# root &#8211; dominant 7th/maj6th, and then I also think of it as adding Emaj7 to the mix but only hinting at it &#8211; to allow myself the freedom to move around melodically &amp; harmonically between major, minor and augmented, #11 sounds in a way that I find very fun and freeing both in the melody &amp; solos. In terms of rhythm &amp; groove, the older I get the more I appreciate soul-jazz- the pacing, the phrasing, the maturity, the emotion, the romance in the pacing of the music, the focus on groove. This song was written with this in mind.&#8221;\n-Mike Casey\nAdditional information:\nRecorded in 1 take on-air via public access TV in a small Connecticut town, 30 minutes away from his first ever gigs as a child, during Mike&#8217;s first post-covid tour run 1 month prior to moving across the US to Los Angeles.

It recharged my body with its frequency, warmth and intensiveness and I never felt it that strong ever before. The beat felt like the bursting sunrays and the flashes that were so sudden and intense. Rushing in and out of the system, flushing through every vein and nerve of the system. It was perfect. I hope you enjoy this one &lt;3\nProcess: Poly Armour produces his tracks in FL Studio, and send them to me. I usually then import it to Ableton and start recording my parts, often as a freestyle. I do the treating of the vocals and mix them in alignment to the beat.

285,"One Sun, One Shadow #58","Shane Lavalette was commissioned by the High Museum in Atlanta to create a series of photographs for the exhibition Picturing the South which would become his monograph, One Sun, One Shadow. It was primarily through traditional music—the sounds of old time, blues, and gospel—that Lavalette had formed a relationship with the region. This history became a natural entry point to explore the connection between music and the landscape of the American South through images.\nOne Sun One Shadow was named one of the “Best Books” of the year by photo-eye and shortlisted for the Kassel Photobook Award and the Author Book Award at Les Rencontres d&#8217;Arles. Lavalette&#8217;s work has been featured by various publications, including The New York Times, TIME, NPR, CNN, The Telegraph, Aperture, Hotshoe, and Foam Magazine. Lavalette’s photographs have been exhibited widely, in addition to being held in private and public collections around the world.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/a6bba86401cae3742cb3c97388567172.jpg,1600,2000,2462624,Music,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x20da3edddcf7db344eff8d7ebbdb26ae2f6978c8/3

213,Jars of Oddities II,"The second piece from the series Jars of Oddities looks at animal hybrids and several other motifs that define beauty. This morbid assemblage brings together biological archetypes that sit contrary in the spectrum of how we define beauty. The question pertaining to the previous piece still persists (i.e isn&#8217;t beauty enhanced when added over ?). I tried to bring together archetypes that are conventionally termed beautiful and hideous into a single imagery making me wonder the impact of context these entities are placed in. Would we still call swans beautiful if they swim in the murky waters? Or is a gem-studded human skull still considered morbid and ugly? This exercise examines the presence/absence of context around objects or ideas when we call them beautiful or ugly. These jars are an ode to finding answers to these questions. The idea pays tribute to the jars of Frederic Ruysch &#8211; a Dutch anatomist and botanist remembered mainly for his methods of anatomical preservations.\nJars of Oddities is born out of my love for biology, symbolism, and highlighting lost stories in a palette of gold and black.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jars-of-Oddities_Ganeshrk-scaled.jpg,2560,1707,1578705,Music,Manifold,https://mint.fun/op/0x7BDB1633894E30D4819Ea4EfbDEBb0b80506103B?ref=0x168F87fBfe36B84E44B9d06278B2aA1CC73d7400
