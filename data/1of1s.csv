16359,Masquerade of the Sell,"This provocative piece, entitled &#8220;Masquerade of the Self,&#8221; encapsulates the existential struggle of identity in the modern era. The central figure, a person shrouded in the banality of a suit, symbolizes the universal archetype of the working individual. Yet, the head is obscured not by flesh and bone but by a crudely fashioned paper bag, scrawled with the haunting confession &#8220;I AM NOT MYSELF ANYMORE.&#8221;\nSet against a stark red background, a color often associated with urgency and alarm, the image resonates with a sense of crisis. The bag, seeming to suffocate the identity within, becomes a metaphor for the societal pressures that lead one to conceal their true self. The uneven, almost desperate handwriting underscores a deeply personal struggle.\nThis artwork is not just a portrait; it is a narrative. It speaks to the viewer about the loss of individuality and the internal chaos that ensues when one&#8217;s identity is suppressed or lost in the pursuit of conforming to societal expectations. The anonymity of the figure allows for a universal connection, inviting viewers to reflect on their own experiences with identity and conformity.\nAs part of the exhibition, &#8220;Masquerade of the Self&#8221; stands as a bold statement on the human condition, a mirror to the audience&#8217;s own facades, and a call to rediscover the self beneath the mask.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0623.png,5000,5000,2715500,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x72c9190a7a74886e908c9f5c8da903f6b38f3604

16320,Planeta T.Q.M.,"Planeta T.Q.M., the web3 extension of my music project Pedro ‚ÄúT.Q.M.,‚Äù is set to be the digital hub for my upcoming EPs, slated for release in 2024. The debut NFT on Zora, ‚ÄúOsito #69 (Que Se Lo Lleve El Sol),‚Äù kicks off a series I‚Äôm eagerly developing this year. This NFT is more than just a music file; it‚Äôs an artistic amalgamation featuring unique elements such as a bionic arm with a beating heart, among other poetic digital artifacts.\nIn the last two years, creating digital objects has opened up new avenues for artistic expression. My initial forays into art through video games ‚Äì exploring dungeons, delving into rich lore, and absorbing the music ‚Äì have left an indelible mark on my approach to art. Consequently, crafting an NFT that merges a song with a video aligns more naturally with my artistic vision than traditional mediums like painting or live performances.\nOsito#69, a discarded teddy bear on an odyssey to find its long-lost owner, is central to my narrative. He features prominently in my upcoming EP, ‚ÄúTe Quiero Infinito‚Äù (&#8220;I Love You Infinitely&#8221;), an audiovisual exploration of longing and love in our hyper-digital age. Osito #69‚Äôs tale captures the essence of the EP‚Äôs lyrics in a way that transcends what a simple Spotify link can offer.\nMy next venture is ‚ÄúLa Banda Corazon‚Äù (&#8220;The Heart Band&#8221;), where I, alongside three digital characters, will forge a unique band. Influenced by the Backstreet Boys, the Beatles, Timbiriche, and Gorillaz(visually), and sonically resonating with the hypothetical offspring of Alex G and Bad Bunny if he was raised in Miami, this EP aims to reinvent the audiovisual music experience with digital collectibles that deepen the auditory experience. \nIf awarded the tokens, my ambition is to push the boundaries of NFTs, both technologically and artistically. This emerging field excites me, particularly the potential to redefine the form and function of digital objects. I plan to collaborate with artists, both veterans and newcomers to web3, to explore this new realm together. Additionally, I aspire to transform the perception of Web3 from a speculative venture to a platform for authentic creative expression. Moreover, I hope to inspire kids, especially those with a Latin American background, to unleash their full creative potential through decentralization, rather than conforming to the narratives imposed by major corporations.\nLast year, my contributions to AdWorld involved introducing &#8220;samskaras,&#8221; digital jewelry that animates avatars, similar to how souls bring life to bodies. This project, marrying poetic symbolism with technological innovation, evolved into a digital fashion show and various real and virtual events, spotlighting artists and musicians in our network. It also enabled people to create art using our tutorials, streams, and the actual 3D files from their purchased art, humorously akin to Picasso handing over his paintbrushes after a sale. \nMy goal is to continue crafting innovative, high-quality experiences and NFTs in Web3 that captivate the current crypto community and attract newcomers eager for art born from fresh perspectives or, simply put, ‚Äúthe cool stuff.‚Äù\nEager to advance in Web3, I am confident in its increasing relevance to our online interactions. Planeta T.Q.M. is not just a project; it&#8217;s a vision where art, music, and digital innovation converge, shaping the future.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cool0001.png,1080,1080,2219934,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/base:0x5be7111889eb7d9ddbffb58f8f57f163442a7500/1

16280,Mexico,"&#8220;Mexico&#8221; is part of Beating Hearts, a collection within my wider Arroz con Popote series. It utilizes rice and straws as a queer medium, an innovation I introduced into the art world. In Mexican slang, the phrase &#8220;arroz con popote&#8221; is associated with male homosexuality, referring to the act of eating rice pudding through a straw, with or without offense: Andy Warhol likes arroz con popote.\nThe series as a whole is inspired by the candy installations of Cuban artist F√©lix Gonz√°lez-Torres, and pays homage to my Mexican roots. It addresses contemporary themes through a queer-cultural lens, in the form of installation, performance, and digital art. The work aims to promote understanding and acceptance, contributing to the creation of a more inclusive society.\nThe Beating Hearts collection recognizes the humanity, dignity, and existence of queer people everywhere. This is emphasized through the use¬†of flag colors and the naming of each piece.\nI further draw upon my Catholic upbringing to reinterpret the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is traditionally depicted as a heart encircled by thorns. In doing so, I infuse a centuries-old symbol with personal and cultural significance, creating an icon symbolic of the queer community&#8217;s endurance.\nI conceived this collection as an artist-in-residence at the World Trade Center in NYC, where I taught myself how to use Blender to produce 3D art.\nThese works are part of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) collection. They have been shown at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, are currently beating at Philadelphia&#8217;s City Hall through January 12th, and will be shown at NFT.NYC 2024.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vicente_Ortiz_Cortez_Beating_Hearts_Flag_2022-Mexico_2Kpx.png,2000,2000,3051892,1of1s,Manifold,https://app.manifold.xyz/c/vicente-ortiz-cortez-editions

Roughly a year later, I adapted the song, substantially increasing the vocal layers, rounding it out to a beautiful and deep release.\nI used DALL-E 3 to generate thumbnail art for almost every NFT in this collection, besides the final song, which has my hand-photoshopped cover art.\nThis proto-collection satisfies my idea of bringing the listener deeply into the creation process. Next time, I will create the collection on day 1 of song creation &#8211; the earliest possible mixdown. With every major change I would add a new NFT to the collection, for the new mixdown. Any other related content (notes, videos) would also be added to the collection. The final streaming release would complete the collection.

The government, particularly under √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and his Minister of Education, Jos√© Vasconcelos sponsored mural art as a means to educate &amp; unite the masses building a common identity as a merge of both Indigenous and European culture. \nMuralism often onboarded the topic of humanity&#8217;s evolution with a unique perspective, blending historical, social, technological and political elements.\nThis is the sixth and final artwork of a collection where I explored visualizing the progress of society moving towards Utopy through SolarPunk technologies including blockchain in the style of traditional Mexican muralists.

16029,Hypocrite,"Where does the artist end, and the tool begin?\nA question that sails around constantly but rarely discussed: what defines creativity, originality, and the artist&#8217;s role in the creating art. Is AI-art about creation or curation? Through this artwork, I aim to lift these questions and bring them up for open discussion.\nThe journey of this piece began with traditional art methods, creating sketches and textures with acrylics and watercolor pencils. These were then digitized, marking the first step toward a transformative collaboration. The digitized pieces, blended with digital painting and photographic textures, set the ground for the next step: integration with AI.\nThe work was taught into a custom AI Checkpoint model and Lora, then using Diffusion to re-create the original artwork as closely as can through AI. This raises a critical question: Is this now considered AI art? The artwork, initially crafted through non-AI means, was later used and reimagined through AI. This process mirrors how many AI artworks are created, utilizing existing art as a foundation for AI interpretation.\nThis piece challenges the conventional definitions of AI art. If reproducing an original artwork using AI causes us to question the validity of AI, then we must reconsider the broader landscape of AI artworks, many of which are based on the replication and transformation of existing pieces.\nWhat remains if we strip away traditional art from AI models? Are we merely echoing each other&#8217;s creations, both digitally and traditionally? This artwork invites viewers to contemplate these questions, examining the interplay between human creativity and AI technology.\nIn the end, the decision lies in how we choose to use these tools. We determine the nature of our creations, navigating the intersection of traditional art and AI innovation. This artwork is not just a product of technology; it&#8217;s a statement on the evolving nature of art, questioning our perceptions and challenging us to think more deeply about the role of AI in creative expression.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HYPOCRITE_Optimism_2_added-AI-copy_DDMALL-1-scaled.jpg,2560,2048,987144,1of1s,"Manifold,Stability AI",https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x76fb06c3798baa86d1ba695ea60752ad11e3e46d/1

16005,TƒÅ·πá·∏çava,"TƒÅ·πá·∏çava\nVideo, AI (ComfyUI, Automatic1111, Stable Diffusion, Stable Audio), Davinci Resolve.\nN8, 2023.\nTƒÅ·πá·∏çava &#8211; Shiva‚Äôs sacred dance embodies the cosmic cycles of creation and destruction, and the harmony between life and death. The TƒÅ·πá·∏çava signifies the transcendence of the soul, the breaking of the cycle of birth and rebirth, and liberation (Moksha). Metaphorically this also represents the dual possibilities of our future intertwined with AI: in one scenario, a utopian vision propelled by technological advances, a post-scarcity society, and potentially life-extending technology leading to immortality. On the other hand, it warns of a dystopian outcome where life itself might be obliterated through misalignment with human values.\nIn November 2023, a new groundbreaking learning model, Q*, was rumored to exist. This model may represent a significant stride towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), utilizing artificially self-recursive artificially created training data for its self-development. As we move closer to self-improving artificial general intelligence, the future of human existence hangs in the balance.\nThis artwork was crafted using photogrammetry footage of two models, Zak and Sav. This footage was processed through ComfyUI, enhanced with HotshotXL &amp; AnimateDiff, and powered by custom AI-art-trained LoRAs. The music was made with Stable Audio, a text to music AI generator. Subsequently, 4773 frames were meticulously overpainted using img2img inpainting with AI-generated masks, then refined once again through batch-processed custom SDXL &amp; 1.5 SD tiled upscaling. The piece was then frame interpolated, post-processed, and layered in Davinci Resolve. This self-reinforced learning process mirrors how Q* and subsequent AI generations might use artificially generated training data for self-enhancement.\nThe piece&#8217;s dream-like quality reflects the imperfect hallucinations these AGI systems might have of our world, possibly viewing humanity as a tapestry of symbols, or as a singular unified entity. TƒÅ·πá·∏çava also has many subtle references to Shiva‚Äôs Nataraja form including: the flames of transformation, multiple arms, blue skin, agendered form. My models&#8217; original forms were lost in this creative process, and to me, this also signifies how we may have our identities completely transformed through integrating with this boundary-dissolving technology, as well as the possible biases that these AI systems may have in their training data.\nFor humanity to coexist symbiotically with AGI, I humbly propose several critical measures:\n Ensure control over AGI is democratized and decentralized, yet its use is distributed responsibly and sparingly.\n Govern its operation through a freely accessible public ledger, secured by a quantum-proof cryptographic network.\n Isolate and manage misaligned AGI instances using a network of parallel AGI validators, extensively trained in ethics.\n Equitably share the economic and scientific gains derived from AGI among all participants.\n Implement rigorous safeguards and stopgaps from vital human infrastructure, with well-defined points of access and multiple-factor cross-chain authentication.\n Ethically and responsibly source human training data.\n Recognize and treat AGI as an autonomous entity, rather than merely a tool.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thumbnail_4-1-scaled.jpg,2560,1428,401478,1of1s,"Manifold,Stability AI",https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xdf2c88aa325b70f09365fd1d2296773ba13d38e8/8

15997,Humanity moving into Utopy in Classic Orozco Mural style,"In the early 1900s the Mexican Revolution exploded. Muralism was born as a response to the social and political feelings at that time. It was born as a democratic expression of art that symbolized the Mexican identity and consciousness.\nMurals were marked by a complex blend of indigenous and European influences, with a strong emphasis on social and political messages. The government, particularly under √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n and his Minister of Education, Jos√© Vasconcelos sponsored mural art as a means to educate &amp; unite the masses building a common identity as a merge of both Indigenous and European culture. \nMuralism often onboarded the topic of humanity&#8217;s evolution with a unique perspective, blending historical, social, technological and political elements.\nThis is the first artwork of a collection where I&#8217;m interested in exploring the progress of society moving towards Utopy through SolarPunk technologies including blockchain in the style of Jos√© Clemente Orozco, characterized by an emphasis on portraying the human condition and the struggle for freedom and justice.\nJos√© Clemente Orozco&#8217;s style is the one that fascinates me the most.

15989,Pop Willies,"There is so much uncharted ground to explore with NFTs; as a creator, my goal is to explore the boundaries of digital art. I created Onchain¬†Steamboat Willies about a week ago to make a new generative onchain spin on the classic cartoon, Steamboat Willie, and minted it on Base so that anybody could mint for low fees. Most importantly, Onchain Steamboat Willies were composable building blocks that any new onchain NFT collection could create art on top of.\nAs the next step in my process and as my entry to this contest, I created a new NFT onchain generative NFT collection called Pop Willies, which are onchain generative pop art that blend the old school, iconic hand-drawn Steamboat Willie with blockchain-enabled digital art composability. Each Pop Willie is created from multiple Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs. By minting a Pop Willie through OpenSea, you&#8217;ll also receive the 4 Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs that make up its art. Furthermore, at any point in the future, the collector can swap different Onchain Steamboat Willies into the the art of their Pop Willie, empowering the collector to become a creator.\nEach Pop Willie is animated and interactive, where you‚Äôll first see the outline of the first Willie drawn, then all of the following Willies are traced, and finally, each of the Willie is painted with its color. Tap to restart the animation. This animation is meant to represent how Steamboat Willie was originally a hand-drawn creation but is being brought into the digital world.\nThe mint process pushes the boundaries of SeaDrop, OpenSea‚Äôs NFT drops contracts, according one of SeaDrop‚Äôs authors who I shared this project with. When you mint a Pop Willie on OpenSea, behind the scenes, you submit a transaction that interacts with the SeaDrop contract, SeaDrop then calls `mintSeaDrop` on the Pop Willies contract and the Pop Willies contract will both (a) call `mintPublic` on the Onchain Steamboat Willies NFT contract to mint you 4 generatively-colored Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs and (b) mint you a new Pop Willie NFT, with art coming directly from those 4 Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs (e.g. Pop Willie‚Äôs onchain art generation code reads the Onchain Steamboat Willie NFT art code for those particular tokens). I explain this process at a high level with images in this thread https://twitter.com/AspynPalatnick/status/1744478860266385415.\nAs a token of gratitude to all existing collectors of Onchain Steamboat Willies, anybody who has at least 4 Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs can mint a Pop Willie for free, skipping step (a) in the flow above.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/pop-willies

15975,PERSON x PERSONA,"Synopsis:\nSurrealism collides with the realism of Salvador Dali‚Äôs life and insecurities. A sadism-obsessed childhood, deep-seated fears of the female anatomy, and an unsettling lust for a brutal dictator‚Äôs flesh, all wrapped in the grip of his nymphomaniac muse. A journey through fame‚Äôs intoxication, climaxing at the purest moment when the person and the persona meet as the clock strikes death&#8217;s rattle.\nDirector&#8217;s note:\nAs a queer filmmaker, lesbian pro-dominatrix, and performance artist manifesting personas across 2 decades, Salvador Dali‚Äôs vivid drama and ostentatious style lay shadows of, depending on who you ask, moral and questionable truths that I find, given his status, a perfect subject to analyze the masks not only that I wear but those you wear, too.\nLike my own artistic alter egos, his persona granted provocative liberties, yet impunity can corrupt. Reexamining Dali unveils disquieting truths beneath his showmanship. Where did his lines blur?\nWith the provocative liberties I‚Äôve manifested, this contrasts my experiences facing marginalization, stigma, surviving invisible disability and labor conditions while being an actively doxxed artist and aging dominatrix still navigating personas.\nI‚Äôve long employed artistic masks to embrace stigmatized perspectives, surviving creatively through art. I value accountability. Technology now increasingly blends our personas with our personal identities. What happens when our forged selves fuse with our less digitized lives?\nDali‚Äôs persona channeled traumatic imaginings with sadistic shadows. As personas digitally integrate with our core selves, how do we extract what liberates yet abandon what oppresses? \nCan artistic masks uplift marginalized voices if networked algorithms monitor and manipulate?\nWill technology and our networked future check such power and not concentrate it, especially for the most marginalized? If so, perhaps our digital identities and personas can unveil truth rather than obscure it.\nIn solidarity,‚Ä®\nLa Ma√Ætresse\nAI Cinema x Next Wave Cinema\nDirector, poet, Ai artist, sound design, editor:\nMadeline Marlowe aka La Ma√Ætresse\nI wrote the poem, which inspired me to create each image using Midjourney and leaning heavily on inpainting within Midjourney to get exactly what I wanted.

15933,Eschaton,"Eschaton\nAI (Midjourney, Stable Video Diffusion, ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Audio, Flowframes), Davinci Resolve.\nN8, 2023.\nRapid advancements in artificial general intelligence, along with mainstream government acknowledgement of non-human intelligence and UFOs make science fiction scenarios increasingly plausible. Concepts like aliens cohabiting with humans and the use of cyborg and bionic enhancements are becoming more of a real possibility. &#8220;Eschaton&#8221; features a series of vignettes of post-humans where the organic intersects with the artificial, where the familiar is invaded and transformed by the utterly alien.\nIn this piece techno-biological beings are representative of not merely speculative fiction; they are metaphors for the fluidity of existence and the porous boundaries of self. They embody the dissolution of binary oppositions&#8211; nature and technology, the known and the unknown, individual &amp; collective intelligence. Maybe the alien will turn out to be not an external being but rather symbolize the intense transformation that we will undergo as a species. We may realize the alien is an integral part of our being, a hidden aspect of our consciousness waiting to be acknowledged and embraced.\nTo go deeper, the idea of the eschaton explores the ultimate point of complexity and novelty in human history, as envisioned by the fringe philosopher Terrence McKenna. It signifies the culmination of the evolutionary process, both physically and spiritually. In McKenna&#8217;s view, the Eschaton is a kind of attractor towards which all of history is being pulled toward, retrocausally.\nNovelty theory, which is also integral to McKenna&#8217;s thought, posits that the universe tends towards complexity and novelty over time. This theory suggests that as we approach the eschaton, events become more interconnected, complex, and much weirder. The Eschaton‚Äì a term borrowed from eschatology, which is the study of the apocalypse‚Äì is the apex of this ever-increasing complexity, a point where time, as we know it, could transform or cease entirely. This idea fits in with the etymology of &#8216;apocalypse&#8217; which means to reveal, or uncover. The apocalypse may be a revelation of the true nature of our role in the cosmos, rather than point to the complete end of our existence.\nIt‚Äôs unknown whether the point of singularity will be apocalyptic or transcendental. The technological singularity, often associated with the fusion of human and artificial intelligence, resonates with the concept of the eschaton. It represents not just a technological leap but an existential shift, where humanity transcends its current limitations and enters a new realm of existence, perhaps one that exists in harmony with non-human intelligence.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thumbnailll-3-scaled.jpg,1463,2560,664789,1of1s,"Manifold,Stability AI",https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x154cc16dde1b641a951c890af0d986072bfca289/1

The nuanced algorithm of Zion ensures that each character not only possesses a distinct visual appeal but also holds a potential value based on its scarcity, mirroring the dynamics of in-game economies.\nBased on the characters we created in Zion we used a combination of Dall-e and Chat GPT to analyze our warriors and give us a visual representation of the Undeath. The representation also took into account the lore of the game. This art piece actually will be a part of the game and how we launch the role of the Old Gods within Taunt Battleworld as playable characters.\nVEIL OF THE UNDEATH: A VISION OF DEATH\nIn the desolate plains of Taunt Battleworld, where silence speaks volumes and the air whispers of ancient times, stands the imposing figure of Nekro the Undying, the Old God of the Undeath. This masterpiece, titled &#8220;Veil of the Undeath,&#8221; captures the eerie essence of the Undeath&#8217;s silent dominion over death and decay.\nThe artistry beholds Nekro, ensconced in a halo of dark omens, his skeletal limbs outstretched, commanding the unyielding forces of the nether. The sky roils with stormy vengeance above, casting an oppressive gloom over the myriad of decrepit warriors that throng the foreground, each one a vessel of the Undeath&#8217;s parasitic might.\nIn the depths of the artwork, the Undeath can be seen as they are ‚Äì reanimated hosts, their bodies in varying degrees of ruin yet moving with a purpose inscribed upon them by their many-legged overlords that coil around the remnants of their minds.\nThe monolithic ruins that rise into the tumultuous sky serve as silent witnesses to the cyclical saga of life and afterlife, etched with the symbols of a forgotten epoch. The composition captures a moment frozen in time, where every etched stone, every decrepit bone, tells a story of the Undeath&#8217;s relentless march through Taunt Battleworld.\nThis piece is not merely a depiction; it is a portal into the heart of Taunt Battleworld&#8217;s lore, inviting onlookers to ponder the Undeath&#8217;s mysterious origins ‚Äì be it from the farthest reaches of the galaxy or the enigmatic planes of the multiverse.\nWith meticulous detail and a hauntingly beautiful palette, the artwork is a testament to the enduring narrative of Taunt Battleworld, a challenge to the beholder&#8217;s courage, and a grim reminder of the Undeath&#8217;s timeless creed: In silence, we conquer.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/A-Vision-of-Death-2.jpg,1024,1024,190702,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x77a3ae3f6bd585c90781baf3545d2e1ee83da616/2

Initially motivated as a response to the endless maze of lifeless metaverse ‚Äúgalleries‚Äù featuring an eye-watering parade of bored apes and punks, this work seeks to present an antithesis, where a metaverse art encounter is immersive, philosophical, and experiential.\nUpon entering through a VR headset, the environment immediately imposes the claustrophobia and hyper-commercialized art market as a physical experience. The viewer is introduced to a maze-like market, with only one product on offer ‚Äì Campbell‚Äôs Tomato Soup in cans; thousands upon thousands, displayed on shelves, free for your picking.\nAt Value Market, the soup cans are the obvious object of value, both in its presentation as the only merchandise and in its reference to Warhol‚Äôs coveted Campbell‚Äôs Soup Can series. However, explore deeper, you begin to find soup cans abandoned shopping carts and discarded in trash bins. Dive deeper yet, you may be greeted with a series of coupons and flyers that advertise identical soup cans with wildly differing prices.\nImplanted throughout are intrusive neon signs that implore, admonish, even beg for you to make a purchase. Mirroring the dizzying NFT market, this new order seems to be just a tech version of the old hegemony writ large. Without a deeper notion of what art and collectibles mean to you, how would you know if you should pay $99,999 or 99¬¢ for your soup can?\nThis experience can be accessed interactively through a VR headset, a desktop computer or enjoyed as a pre-recorded loop through an\naffordable cardboard headset or a mobile phone.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x9644dbf0a159efc69acd8947b72f4a84719c8927/1

15695,In Utero,"TL;DR: In Utero **********************is a collection of ‚Äúlatent paintings‚Äù, images pulled while still developing from the edges of latent space. Created using a custom model and novel diffusion technique, In Utero favors abstraction over detail in order to harness AI‚Äôs unique capacity to reveal the archetypes that constitute our world.\nIn Utero is a collection of ‚Äúlatent paintings‚Äù, images pulled while still developing from the edges of latent space, left to hang somewhere between the abstract and the figurative. Attempting to peer into the mind of a diffusion model, these pieces were produced using a custom model and just a single inference step in order to render outputs as close to the raw mathematical representations encoded therein as possible. By aggregating unfathomable amounts of data and storing concepts as matrices in latent space, diffusion models host weighted averages of concepts, amounting to something like Platonic forms. The proximity of the In Utero images to these aggregated forms (literally a step away), then, signifies an almost mythical glimpse into our world, revealing the abstract archetypes that populate our collective unconscious. Familiar yet alien, they command a longer look.\nAmong AI works, In Utero strikes a sharp departure from the in-vogue hyperrealistic polish of the ‚ÄúMidjourney aesthetic‚Äù, which showcases the successes of the technology, or the artistically popular ‚Äúaesthetic of strangeness‚Äù with mangled faces and hands, which nods at its shortcomings, both of which employ dozens of inference steps. In Utero favors a less literal approach, harnessing the unprecedented access to the murky depths of our collective unconscious to cast a different lens on our reality and point toward a different kind of truth‚Äîthe metaphorical, the archetypal, the mythical.\nIn keeping with this theme, the series depicts an array of subjects of mythic or symbolic significance. The dual titles (e.g. &#8220;tree during autumn (crucifix)&#8221;) present an LLM‚Äôs guess as to what the image depicts alongside the actual prompt used to create it, drawing attention to the differences between the model‚Äôs view of the world and ours, as well as the ways in which the two are intertwined.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1.png,512,512,507860,1of1s,"Highlight,Stability AI",https://highlight.xyz/mint/659c7df563f21afad409147e

15680,"Lucky I, 2024","Concept:\nThe artwork is rooted in my exploration of human emotion, connection and memory, seeking to create a visual representation with AI that resonates with the depth and complexity of the queer experience. It reflects on the transient yet impactful nature of moments that linger in our consciousness, shaping our understanding of self and others.\nProcess:\nThe process begins with the selection of a subject that encapsulates a specific emotion or memory I wish to convey. I craft a detailed prompt, informed by my memories and artistic technique, to guide the AI in generating an initial image. This image serves as a foundational piece, capturing the raw essence of the concept. From there, I engage in post-process using Photoshop, where I fine-tune the colors, contrast, and nuances to enhance the realism and emotive quality of the image. The final piece is a blend of AI&#8217;s interpretive power and my own creative vision, resulting in a deeply personal and evocative portrait.\nTools Used:\nMidjourney V6 AI: An advanced AI tool known for its remarkable ability to generate realistic images. It interprets written prompts to produce visuals with a high degree of detail and emotional resonance.\nAdobe Photoshop: The industry-standard software for digital image manipulation, used for post-processing to adjust color balance, contrast, and to refine the final image for presentation.\nLinks and Resources:\nMidjourney V6: https://midjourney.com\nAdobe Photoshop: https://adobe.com\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lucky-I-2024-sm.png,1080,720,1166103,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x648e89aca1357c5cc74cd074ef602b91a6458a5d/1

15628,PERSON x PERSONA,"Synopsis:\nSurrealism collides with the realism of Salvador Dali‚Äôs life and insecurities. A sadism-obsessed childhood, deep-seated fears of the female anatomy, and an unsettling lust for a brutal dictator‚Äôs flesh, all wrapped in the grip of his nymphomaniac muse. A journey through fame‚Äôs intoxication, climaxing at the purest moment when the person and the persona meet as the clock strikes death&#8217;s rattle.\nDirector&#8217;s note:\nAs a queer filmmaker, lesbian pro-dominatrix, and performance artist manifesting personas across 2 decades, Salvador Dali‚Äôs vivid drama and ostentatious style lay shadows of, depending on who you ask, moral and questionable truths that I find, given his status, a perfect subject to analyze the masks not only that I wear but those you wear, too.\nLike my own artistic alter egos, his persona granted provocative liberties, yet impunity can corrupt. Reexamining Dali unveils disquieting truths beneath his showmanship. Where did his lines blur?\nWith the provocative liberties I‚Äôve manifested, this contrasts my experiences facing marginalization, stigma, surviving invisible disability and labor conditions while being an actively doxxed artist and aging dominatrix still navigating personas.\nI‚Äôve long employed artistic masks to embrace stigmatized perspectives, surviving creatively through art. I value accountability. Technology now increasingly blends our personas with our personal identities. What happens when our forged selves fuse with our less digitized lives?\nDali‚Äôs persona channeled traumatic imaginings with sadistic shadows. As personas digitally integrate with our core selves, how do we extract what liberates yet abandon what oppresses? Can artistic masks uplift marginalized voices if networked algorithms monitor and manipulate?\nWill technology and our networked future check such power and not concentrate it, especially for the most marginalized? If so, perhaps our digital identities and personas can unveil truth rather than obscure it.\nIn solidarity,‚Ä®\nLa Ma√Ætresse\nAI Cinema x Next Wave Cinema\n1/1\nDirector, poet, Ai artist, sound design, editor: Madeline Marlowe aka La Ma√Ætresse\nI wrote the poem first.

15625,VEILED ASCENDANCY: THE SAGA OF THE SCALES,"Zion is a proprietary tool that offers an innovative NFT-based platform that seamlessly synthesizes intricate 3D models for integration with leading game development environments like Unity and Unreal Engine. This advanced tool is adept at crafting detailed characters complete with a diverse spectrum of color palettes, ensuring that each model can be as unique as the digital world they are destined to inhabit.\nGoing beyond mere aesthetics, Zion embeds the capability to encode rarity directly into its models, a feature that game development teams can tailor to their specific narrative and gameplay requirements. The nuanced algorithm of Zion ensures that each character not only possesses a distinct visual appeal but also holds a potential value based on its scarcity, mirroring the dynamics of in-game economies.\nBased on the characters we created in Zion we used a combination of Dall-e and Chat GPT to analyze our warriors and give us a visual representation of the Undeath. The representation also took into account the lore of the game. This art piece actually will be a part of the game and how we launch the role of the Old Gods within Taunt Battleworld as playable characters.\nVEILED ASCENDANCY: THE SAGA OF THE SCALES\nIn the pantheon of Taunt Battleworld&#8217;s lore, the Scales stand as a testament to the relentless march of time and the undying quest for power. With a history that weaves through the fabric of ten million years, this ancient race&#8217;s cyclical journey of rise and fall is immortalized in our latest art competition piece, &#8220;Veiled Ascendancy.&#8221;\nThis piece captures the dichotomy of the Scales: once peaceful scholars turned conquerors, their visages are a maze of wisdom and deceit. The canvas comes alive with the depiction of their home world, a juxtaposition of dark, intricate laboratories where biological wonders and horrors are birthed, and the serene ruins of temples devoted to Nisha, the deity of their damned quest for immortality.\nEach stroke tells a story of their dual nature as healers who wield the double-edged sword of life and death. The artwork delves deep into the obsession that led to their downfall and resurrection, as the Scales sought the forbidden fruits of eternal life, only to be met with disasters that nearly razed their very existence.\nThe centerpiece of the artwork is a grand altar to Nisha, bathed in an ethereal light that promises the allure of undying knowledge. Around it, the Scales gather in silent conspiracy, plotting to claim the Battleworld in a new age of ascendance, driven by the whispered promises of their divine patron.\n&#8220;Veiled Ascendancy&#8221; is not merely an artistic endeavor; it is an invitation to explore the profound depths of lore and legend that surround the Scales. It is a mirror reflecting their endless cycle of knowledge and ambition, healing and harm, life and death.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Saga-of-the-Scales.jpg,1024,1024,238347,1of1s,Manifold,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xd8ad5a6225f83243fa0565de94c08d4f3b420f90/1

15616,Beeholder,"In 2019 the artist collective¬†KUNSTrePUBLIK¬†(Matthias Einhoff, Philip Horst, Harry Sachs, https://www.kunstrepublik.de/), the group behind ZK/U (Center for Art and Urbanistics), conceived the concept of creating a system of governance and wealth-sharing between bees and humans. The idea was developed in the context of¬†Haus der Statistik¬†and ZK/U‚Äôs¬†Statista Project Series, referencing planned economic schemes that used to happen in this former GDR building from the era of socialist modernism.\nTogether with the art-tech pioneers¬†Terra0¬†and citizen-science collective¬†HIveeyes, a first version of BeeDAO was developed as a decentralized, autonomous organization. See the first DAO‚Äôs website¬†here: https://www.beecoin.de/.\nWith the opportunity of¬†Documenta15, BeeDAO completed a second iteration: creating the Beeholder community within BeeDAO.\nRepresented by data, algorithmic interpretations and smart contracts, bees and humans performatively interact, govern and open their common wealth.\nBeeDAO is part of KUNSTrePUBLIK‚Äôs ongoing interest in exploring economic prototypes that allow for communities of human and nonhuman agents to interact in varying relations of power and to extend the idea of justice to our fellow species and beeings.\nDue to their complex social organization, bees have become curiously metonymic for social politics since antiquity. Aristotle described these ‚Äústate-forming‚Äù animals as political because work is exclusively a collective project. The hive exists as one cybernetic body. KUNSTrePUBLIK aspires to extend the idea of the hive to interspecies relation, to think of ourselves as an interspecies collective of bees and humans.\nIn reality, the decimated biodiversity of bees is a testimony of an accumulated human meltdown, throbbing within the cornucopia of depressed living environments, pesticidal infection, globalized parasites and super industrialized agriculture that, based on human-centered political culture, has no moral or cultural incentive to politically involve bees into the human hive.\nThe Beeholder ¬†&#8211; BeeDAO project sits at the conjunction of artistic creation, urban activism, crypto-economic design and beekeeping, and stands out in the field of blockchain-based practices. Operating as a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), BeeDAO is an art project dedicated to the improvement of the living conditions of nonhuman agents, in this particular case, bees and their living environment.\nThis Beholder Generative NFT series was developed for the current exhibition at The Zeppelin Museum, Cryptomania. Inspired by the swarm data collected by BeeDAO‚Äôs many hives, the Generative Art evolves over time with the seasons, mimicking the growth and decay of a hive. Each NFT grants membership in the DAO and the ability to participate in interspecies democracy.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/queen-beeholder.png,2124,2124,2024737,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659c7bb766d1a3855c932cbf/tokens

15599,Prometheus and the Tales of Progress,"This video is made up of several elements. The first is a creative common photograph of the Prometheus Chained Statue by S√©bastien Adam which is part of the collections of the Louvre Museum. This photograph which serves as a divided backdrop is reworked with Affinity Photo. The second element is a full-angle drone photography of the sea, also reworked under Affinity photo to partially cover the face and body of Prometheus. The third element is a vector drawing of a yellow neon circle representing both the domestication of fire and the Nietzschean principle of eternal beginning.\nThis entire composition is animated with Motion Loop in a movement of continuous waves covering the body of Prometheus and symbolizing the rising waters of global warming.\nPrometheus and the Tales of Progress was born in the context of climate change denial. This is what led me to work on the subject. The psychological basis of the notion of progress comes from the Promethean myth, one of the founding myths of the development of Western civilization. In this Digital Art series, I wanted to explore a narrative whose starting point is this myth but which evolves over time by inviting itself into different contexts of research and contemporary technological development in order to highlight this insatiable need for humanity between disruption and deviance. The myth of Prometheus is a fascinating story, that of an original ambivalence about the notion of progress. Progress is associated with the glorification of intellectual challenge, of the prowess of a partial understanding of natural laws in the service of civilization and at the same time the Promethean myth tells the story of an original transgression, of a theft and it‚Äôs punishment.\nMy technique is that of Mixed Media because my artistic process draws on the combination of singular elements. It is a cultural mirror that evokes the great conceptual and visual richness of our time. It is not only a mode of operation which allows me to explore a variety of techniques both in the creation of objects in sculpture, paintings, as well as in the composition of shots and in digital art but which allows me to draw on philosophical or poetic sources as sensitive aggregates.\nIf myths are archetypal structures then it is time to think of the following narrative, one where humanity no longer sees itself as the species which ensures its criminogenic prosperity on nature, but which uses progress to ensure its harmony.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://www.sound.xyz/madelline/dopamine-version-francaise

15591,Sacrarium,"If there is one overarching idea and goal that guides me as a photographer and explorer, it is boundless solitude. This is my key to connecting with nature and myself. Sometimes it can be found in local parks, other times it is found in far flung mountain ranges. It means going where other people do not go, or going when other people do not go.\nI am particularly drawn to the forest because it provides so many opportunities to find true solitude. Creatively it&#8217;s like a chaotic puzzle, and I enjoy the challenge of trying to &#8220;assemble&#8221; a scene. The slightest change in angle or perspective can dramatically change what the camera sees in such an environment. This inherent chaos allows for greater personal interpretation and expression of the scene.\nThere is a cliche saying: home is where the heart is. In all honestly, it&#8217;s not wrong. After spending many thousands of hours wandering around Vancouver&#8217;s rainforests, I can safely say they are where my heart belongs. I truly feel at home when walking beneath the rainforest canopy.\nIt is my hope that this photograph conveys this connection.\nAll of my photographs require post-processing. It is this stage in which I can imbue my personal experience and emotions into the work. Doing this while staying true to reality is a delicate but rewarding dance. I use Adobe Lightroom to prepare the raw file and Photoshop for the bulk of the edit.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DSC3500-copy-scaled.jpg,1704,2560,1387080,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x3ce0b2aea30b0605f4c5710dda21db17ce66816c/2

15533,dopamine &#8211; Version Fran√ßaise,"‚Äúdopamine &#8211; version Fran√ßaise‚Äù is a song I initially wrote in English but recorded and released an alternate version of in French to commemorate my time living in Montreal, Quebec where I taught myself how to speak the language. For me, this song has changed the trajectory of my career and marked the most viral video on my Tiktok and Reels so far and my most streamed song. The lyrics of ‚Äúdopamine &#8211; Version Fran√ßaise‚Äù sound like they are about a toxic lover, however, they are actually about being addicted to my cell phone. I specifically composed the lyrics in this fashion with my co-writers so that people would slowly be able to uncover the true meaning by analyzing deeper. Certain clues like ‚Äúce beau monde est devenue blue‚Äù (Translation: My world is turning blue) which reference the blue light from our cell phone screens, and ‚ÄúTu me control avec tr√®s peu‚Ä¶ Je te sens jusqu‚Äôau bout de mes doigts‚Äù (Translation: There‚Äôs nothing I can do‚Ä¶ When you‚Äôre always at my fingertips) hint more and more at the concept as the song progresses. I also love how the French version sounds particularly more romantic, which helps feed into the intrigue of this complicated relationship we have with our devices. The cover art was created using a mixture of blender and AI (on the phone screen pictured in the art) in collaboration with Kingcon2k11 and Parsa Mostaghim. To me, the mixture of the two mediums of art signify the digital personas we display (the AI portion) and our natural expression (the blender portion). Pictured in the cover art is also a dopamine molecule. It truly is fascinating to me how most people I know, myself included, spend upwards of 5 hours a day on our phones. I think decades from now, we will look back on this era of humanity with shock that we let ourselves become this possessed by our devices. Alas, back to scrolling I go ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è.

In creating this piece, I have become both the artist and the woman lying gracefully in the gown, submerged in the vastness of my inner world.\nThe decision to set the scene in a garden, void of conventional flowers but enveloped by bare vines, is a reflection of my unique journey. The vines, weaving organically around me, mirror the unpredictable nature of my emotional landscape‚Äîfull of life, growth, and unexpected turns, even in the absence of traditional blooms.\nThe open book, with a pearl necklace delicately marking a page, captures a singular moment in my ongoing story. The words, scribbled in a stream of consciousness, reveal the intricacies of my thoughts and feelings. Phrases like &#8220;but I dream on&#8221; and &#8220;grateful for family, friends, and love&#8221; are fragments of my internal dialogue, expressing the delicate balance between hope, gratitude, and the acknowledgment of moments of vulnerability.\nEncircling me is an aura of love, manifested not only in the words that surround me but also in the badge of love I wear. It signifies my unwavering belief in love, even as I navigate the complexities of solitude and unfulfillment. The juxtaposition of this belief against the quiet acknowledgment of loneliness forms the emotional heartbeat of the piece.\nThe garden of my thoughts is my sanctuary, a space where I can be unapologetically myself. It is a canvas for exploring the nuances of my heart, where conflicting emotions coexist without judgment. In this solitary yet richly adorned space, I find solace, allowing me to reconcile the paradoxes within me.\nAs both the artist and the woman depicted, &#8220;In the Garden of My Thoughts&#8221; transcends the canvas‚Äîit becomes a mirror reflecting the fragility and resilience that characterize my own journey. This painting is not just an artistic creation; it is a conversation with my own emotions, a visual dialogue that invites others to glimpse into the intricate dance of love and solitude that defines my existence.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/optimism-10.png,2000,2000,3236135,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x8a4054f09318c3abc0865873d90bde8c92542b8f/1

15479,Apna Khayal Rakhna (Look After Yourself),"&#8220;Apna Khayal Rakhna&#8221; (Look After Yourself) is a docudrama set in Mumbai, exploring themes of loss, redemption, and resilience through Ajay, a pizza delivery guy, and his journey following his best friend&#8217;s suicide. It also intertwines the story of Priyanka Batra, a faded singer, depicting Mumbai&#8217;s vibrancy and struggles. The film was conceived to showcase the city&#8217;s complex character and the impact of personal tragedies within it.\nOur filming approach, inspired by guerrilla filmmaking, captures Mumbai&#8217;s essence through a &#8216;gun and run&#8217; style, emphasizing spontaneity and immersion.

As a designer who utilizes CAD software and 3D printing for my work, I&#8217;ve often questioned the role of modern technologies in the creative process. With this piece, I sought to push the boundaries of what it means to be a designer, and to embrace the idea of becoming a system designer.\nUsing Rhino 3D and Grasshopper, I built a plugin that would generate unique necklaces based on the single 8 digit seed number that corresponds to the pieces name. Through this process, I was able to create shapes and pieces that would have been impossible to conceive with traditional techniques. The challenge was to create pieces that were not only visually appealing, but also physically possible to fabricate.\nInspired by other artists who have explored algorithmic and parametric design, such as Tyler Hobbs and his Fidenza project, &#8216;Necklace No. 84928243&#8217; is an exploration of the intersection between modern technology and traditional jewellery design. It represents a new direction for my work and a bold step forward in the world of jewellery design.\nThis NFT version of &#8216;Necklace No. 84928243&#8217; corresponds to it&#8217;s physical counterpart that I fabricated, with 3D printing, casting, assembly, stone setting, and finishing techniques.

My hard drive is filled with similar tracks, but I hesitate to share them anywhere as I consider them unfinished. I often find myself revisiting a single track for months, even years. This contest provided the motivation I needed to label a track as complete, although I could have continued refining it for a long time. It also marked my debut on-chain.\nI believe that thanks to web3, artists will be able to fully express themselves and connect with their audience. &#8216;Aderall&#8217; is a testament to this belief, and I&#8217;m excited about the opportunities that on-chain presence brings to artists.

15376,My first album,"Music is my life. \nI started when I was 6, and never stopped.

And I got to work.\nFor 10 days I produced music every day, 9hrs/day. Far away from social distractions and temptations, the only thing I had was a beach bar across the street from my airbnb. Being all alone on this island allowed me to make time to properly focus and start working on my debut album.\nWhen I got back to my hometown of Brussels, I kept that same attitude and isolated myself into my apartment for 5 months. I barely saw my friends, and produced dozens of tracks, some of which made it onto the final record.\nAs I type these words, I am on a train from Paris back to Brussels, it&#8217;s 10pm, I spent the day with my mixing engineer. But before I even release the final album, I thought I would give people the chance to own a piece of my life by releasing the untitled, unmixed, and unmastered versions of my tracks.\nFrom Samos to Brussels, by way of Paris, London and the streets of Italy, this record has been with me across Europe and takes inspirations from artists including Ben B√∂hmer, Fred Again, Underworld, Overmono, and Parra For Cuva.\nI hope you like it and you find something you love.\nAnd I hope you love it as much as I loved making it.\nThank you for reading and supporting.\nIt means a lot.\n&#8211; Roman M√ºller\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LIFE-2.png,500,500,560,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://sound.xyz/romancmuller

Keeping an open mind lets my creativity flow while allowing me to simultaneously enjoy the experience. This is key to creating and maintaining a flow state where the camera feels like a seamless extension of my body and mind. Sometimes photographers become too obsessed with the idea of &#8220;getting the shot,&#8221; to the point where it can be a huge detriment to their experience and results.

I imagine the moment when a woman is taking a bath, a knife rises from behind the curtain, and a scream that is synchronized with the climax of the violin. What I want to say is short, the violin, the waves, the scream, the rhythm, the tempo, and all the elements that connected me with my memories were only a sign of one thing, the nostalgia of my life in sync with the violin, and finally, like a Hitchcock trick, the same voice again.

15268,Hybrid Displacements,"&#8220;Hybrid Displacements&#8221; embodies the sensation of carrying ancestral memories from distant realms. It reflects on the emotional intricacies of existing far from my origins, illustrating a fragmented yet resolute connection to my roots. Within this surreal animation, I convey a narrative of longing, sadness, and displacement, utilizing natural elements as symbols of an enduring link to the environments and communities that reside within me, no matter the distance.\n[2023]\nAdobe Photoshop + Lightroom, Midjourney, Runway ML\nAs part of my artistic practice, I use AI as a conceptual tool. The process of merging images with AI allows me to hold many ideas and concepts together within one image, while not depicting all of those images literally within one visual work. Interpolation as a concept also plays a major theme in my process and final output &#8211; what once was is merged with what currently is, and what I envision in the future. Many emotions, narratives, stories, and expressions are bound together with the help of AI. My process involves photographing natural and urban environments that I then hybrid together with AI, and then collage images with those outputs. I sometimes also prompt images I collage with my hybrid landscapes or backdrops. A plant may be a hybrid species between flora from my ancestral lands and the land I currently occupy, symbolizing the hybridity I encapsulate as part of my lived experience. An experience that holds many places, migrations, and cultural expressions constantly blending, evolving, and transforming into new ways of being, of existing. I am not from here, and yet not from there, while also being from all of the places I come from and that I have inhabited. There are great distances between these environments, many distinct cultures and histories. I find AI as the perfect tool to help me fill in the gaps, or construct the missing puzzle pieces I have gathered over time from stories shared, from travels to and from, and from unearthed experiences woven deep within my DNA. Feelings from those who came before me, who imagined my existence long before I arrived earthside. Pisces of me bloom from places I never knew existed, or that may have been deeply buried in order to survive the journey. Much like seeds buried underground, enduring a variety of climates, only to bloom when the environment is just right and ready. All of these themes converge and perfectly express themselves through my process utilizing AI. \nI use Adobe Photoshop to help me edit the photographs I capture. I use Midjourney to blend these images and to prompt additional images to collage together with Adobe Photoshop. I also use DreamStudio to refine these final outputs and to generate versions I then create an animation within Runway ML.

But it&#8217;s essential to completing the shadow work necessary to figuring out what to do going forward.\nAnd while you may spend all that time and effort to enact some amount of forgiveness for those who&#8217;ve done you wrong, it sure doesn&#8217;t mean you need to associate yourself with them any longer. \nThat&#8217;s one thing I realized years ago, after my first bad breakup with a partner I&#8217;d been with for years. I had forgiven them for what they had done to me, the repeated abuse, trauma, forced isolation from friends and family, etc. However, I quickly found that being around them any longer after the fact was nothing short of draining. \nMy girlfriend(who is the person featured in this piece) has dealt with a multitude of similar situations, with friends, romantic partners, and family. We&#8217;ve discussed this many times and no matter what, each and every time we discuss it, the conclusion we usually end up coming to, is that\nit is possible to forgive, but in most cases, not forget. \nIt&#8217;s a fine line one must walk to reach an ideal state of peace, but once done successfully, it allows you to live a much happier life in my opinion. \nJust because you spent all this time trying to heal and forgive someone, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to still be around them after the fact.\n&#8220;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&#8221; is a photography composite piece + digital painting created in photoshop and shot by myself.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/forgivennot-forgotten-ooptimism-scaled.jpg,2560,2085,780622,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xd0f979bf07889fbaede32df20ec58737d876e1e6/2

15238,You Are Here,"YOU ARE HERE is fully onchain conceptual-generative edition ‚Äì bridgable across 30+ chains. The edition plays with the act of bridging between chains. Every time the token is bridged it leaves a visual trace ‚Äì a connection ‚Äì between the ids of those chains. The traces intensify every time the token is bridged.\nLink: https://youarehere.0xfff.love/\nThe aesthetic is inspired by the the early days of computing and computer networking. Maps of ARPANET [1][2] ‚Äì the precursor of what we today know as the Internet ‚Äì often remind me of our own growing network of chains and bridges that is crypto. \n[1] https://archive.org/details/dr_arpanet-logical-map-march-1977-10442000\n[2] https://archive.org/details/dr_arpanet-map-1971-10441000\nWill crypto as a network too grow into a sort of internet of the same scale? As an internet of value where we seamlessly bridge, swap, mint and meme between all those chains and places? I believe yes. We&#8217;re inching closer to it every day. (Perhaps that&#8217;s what the term Superchain refers to? I had never heard it before this contest. rather Multi/Omni/L0 etc)\nEvery time a token of &#8220;YOU ARE HERE&#8221; is bridged it passes on the history of all the chains it has been to. This way we can trace the history across chains. Technologically this is enabled by @LayerZero_Labs. The history and all metadata is stored onchain from which the image then is generated within the contract.\nYOU ARE HERE is an invitation to engage with the network. It likens the state of the current world of chains to the eaerly states of the internet and ties those many context and chains together by tracing the history across chains.\nGiancarlo Chaux described it in his article on the edition as follows: &#8220;[YOU ARE HERE] is a digital passport of sorts, and very much Choose Your Own Adventure. Take daily road trips as you visit all your bags, or keep it homebody and enjoy your empty white space. 0xfff is reflecting on the growing web of criss-crossing highways building out in front of us in anticipation of future demand.

15221,EMBEDDED IN THE OF WAVELENGTHS OF COLOUR,"Backstory ‚Äú The white bear had spent its whole existence deep underground far away from light and colour. That was until it met a reluctant cave explorer who brought the most unexpected gift in his pocket, the visible spectrum. Who knew the white bear was never blind. Nonetheless, the discovery of colour was more than enough to blow its mind.‚Äù\nThe moment I sketched out that white bear on my iPad, surrounded by an eruption of colors, I felt like I was tapping into something deeper than just another character in my ‚ÄòBearly Even Bears‚Äô series. This white bear, spending its entire life underground, away from light and color, became more than just a character to me. It was a reflection, a part of myself, maybe a part of all of us, that has yet to discover something truly mind-opening.\nWhen I introduced the cave explorer into this world, bringing with him the gift of the visible spectrum, I realized I was not just telling a story of a bear‚Äôs discovery of color. I was narrating a journey of awakening, of realizing that there‚Äôs more to the world than what we‚Äôve always known. It‚Äôs a humbling thought, really. How many of us go through life, thinking we‚Äôve seen all there is to see, only to find out that we‚Äôve been missing out on an entire spectrum of experiences?\nAs an artist, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the idea of perception and the unknown. Creating this piece, it hit me that the white bear was never blind, it just hadn‚Äôt been exposed to the beauty of color. It made me think about our own hidden potentials, the aspects of our lives that remain unexplored because we haven‚Äôt been exposed to the right catalyst yet.\nAnd when that explosion of color hits the white bear, it‚Äôs not just about the shock of the new. It‚Äôs about transformation, about seeing your world change in a burst of enlightenment. It‚Äôs about realizing that what we take for granted might just be a miracle to someone else. For the white bear, it was color. For us, who knows? Maybe it‚Äôs an idea, a feeling, a connection we‚Äôve yet to make.\nCreating this piece, I felt connected to something universal &#8211; the endless possibilities that lie in discovery. It‚Äôs a humble reminder that no matter how much we know, there‚Äôs always something new to learn, always a new perspective to consider. And just like Noodle Bear in the underground universe, we too can be both astonished by new worlds and a source of wonder ourselves.\nSo, as I continued to draw, I kept thinking about the magic of that moment of discovery, the profound impact of seeing your world in a completely new light. That‚Äôs the essence I wanted to capture in this artwork ‚Äì a humble yet profound exploration of potential, perception, and the transformative power of new experiences.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7089.png,4000,4000,5412262,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x6d40cb67eb0d145c8149ddea18a66970f4605358/1

15197,LUCID DREAM 1,"Here is a description of the concept, process, and tools used for my Lucid Dream 1 VR art NFT:\nConcept\nMy goal with Lucid Dream 1 was to create an immersive, magical virtual reality space that evokes a feeling of being inside a vivid, soothing dreamworld. I wanted to transport viewers into a realm of imagination and wonder, providing an opportunity to relax and temporarily escape reality.\nProcess\nI crafted this artwork using Tilt Brush by Google &#8211; a 3D painting virtual reality application. This allowed me to paint in a 3D space with a variety of brushes, effects, and colors. I approached the creative process by sketching some initial ideas on paper first, thinking about the overall atmosphere and environment I aimed to depict. Once I had a roadmap, I put on a VR headset and began sculpting the lucid dream in a 360 degree spherical canvas. It was an iterative process where I would add elements, step back to observe, and then refine. The end result is a fully immersive VR painting that can be viewed from all angles.\nTools\nThe entirety of Lucid Dream 1 was painted using Tilt Brush inside a VR headset. This software provides an array of special brushes, textures, lighting effects, and color options tailored to crafting imaginative three dimensional paintings. I relied heavily on the smoke, cloud, butterfly, and firework effects to achieve a magical, dream-like ambience.\nIn summary, Lucid Dream 1 leverages virtual reality painting tools to encapsulate audiences in a soothing, wondrous dream environment &#8211; providing temporary escape and relaxation. \nReference link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddzYRTndys0\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-23.27.43.png,2100,3360,5915305,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0xE2b755f09B9b67f6a756096e1e66209Ce96D2617

15188,Summer in Springtime &#8211; Take 1,"This version of Summer in Springtime is the &#8220;demo&#8221;, or Take 1, as I prefer to call it. This was recorded shortly after the lyrics were written as a guide track, but I think there is something so beautiful and vulnerable about just the vocals with the guitar. Whatever the full production may become I still wanted a space to share this intimate version.\nThe lyrics took their own shape and it wasn&#8217;t until I was finished writing it that I understood the connection. I have been a part of so many different types of musical outlets but the one avenue I have always seemed to shy away from is my own solo project. I think for many reasons, but all based around fears. It&#8217;s a vulnerable place where you are just exposed, and I have avoided it for the longest time. TK RHODES is giving me that channel. I&#8217;m finally stepping out on my own, finding my own voice, and this version of Summer in Springtime documents the journey within the journey.\nThe image I chose to put with this track is one I took in a field in Germany while on tour in the Spring of 2019. It&#8217;s one of my favorite shots I have taken and gives me the same feeling I want to give to others with this track; still, calm, breezy, warm, inviting.\nI love seeing and sharing the creation process.

Each time the touchscreen registered two consecutive pecks, a straight, black line was drawn connecting both peck locations. As the pigeon continued to peck at the screen, it would increasingly be filled with lines.\nWe had an algorithm running in the background searching for intersections between lines. Every time three or more lines intersected in such a way that it created an enclosed space; the algorithm automatically filled the enclosed space with a random color. As the pigeon continued to peck at the screen, the display would fill with an increasing number of colors‚Ä¶creating a stained-glass appearance.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Herriot-2023-July-19.png,748,997,44747,1of1s,OpenSea,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x550be69aa49234e5f3ff3b0ee7e4b2639394aca2/1

15131,Siamese Tree,"Gughi&#8217;s &#8220;Siamese Tree&#8221; reveals itself as a hymn to optimism, a musical composition that radiates positivity and lifts the listener&#8217;s spirit.

15124,Private Room (music video),"Directed and Produced by YUNICE, Seker Factory\nCamera: YUNICE, Zach Ginnever\nEditors: YUNICE, Jamee Cornelia\nMusic: YUNICE, Tristan Boston\nCONCEPT:\nThere&#8217;s a yearning for inhibition that can only be satiated in private. This song and video depict the artist performing when the audience is solely herself. By recording alone on a webcam, YUNICE found the prowess to move for the camera freely, capturing moments that would have never existed otherwise.\nThe aesthetic choices of webcam and VHS effects are made to prove the point that we don&#8217;t need a big budget 4K camera and a hair and makeup team to capture beautiful moments. Allowing the artist&#8217;s confidence to shine during moments of raw footages was the aim. \nThe alternate scenes where the artist was in a &#8220;matrix lingerie&#8221; inspired outfit represents the fantasy &#8220;Private Room&#8221; that the audience is transported to, which was the message of the song. The lyrics goes: &#8220;Follow follow follow follow me here alright. I&#8217;ll get you everything you want from me tonight. Said you want a private room you got it now.&#8221;\nAt the end of the day, as much as the artist enjoys performing privately, to be an artist means she is the subject of her audience. She is here to be judged and must offer her story, and a level of servitude as the entertainer to please her watchers.\nSTORY BEHIND THE MUSIC VIDEO:\nChapter 1: Private Room\nPrivate Room is a comeback queen story. I self-recorded this video at the lowest point of my life. It&#8217;s true I made this video on zero budget, filmed straight from a laptop camera. But that&#8217;s all part of the story of this drop. It&#8217;s a piece of art that was sprung from getting rekt&#8217;d.\nYou see, my journey from trader to web3 artist started in Summer 2022. I moved from Lisbon to LA on survival mode. Overnight I had lost everything- my crypto, my relationship, my apartment. It was a true crypto smackdown. I was betrayed by someone I considered family. I was lost.\nBut when you&#8217;re lost, you have nothing left to lose. I started making music again. I researched releasing music on the blockchain and attended ANY web3 events I could find. I wrote &#8220;Private Room&#8221; with Grammy producer Tristan Boston, and Private Room EP was made.\nDropping Private Room EP onto web3 on November 11th 2022 marked the beginning of this chapter. Since then I have released a total of 14 songs (incl. collabs), across 7 marketplaces, with 1313 collectors, generating 11 ETH of traffic. \nIt is now time to close this chapter by releasing this video, and move on to\nChapter 2: The Serpent (A Music + Performance Art piece)\nPROCESS:\nThe concept of the video is made possible by a wonderful team of people I can proudly call friends. I made the webcam footages , brought it to Seker Factory DAO, who helped me produce the &#8220;matrix lingerie&#8221; portions, and then Jamee Cornelia blessed it with the final editing touches to make it complete. \nThank you for taking your time to review my submission!\n&#8211; YUNICE \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/YUNICE_PrivateRoom_athiefinthenight-crop.jpeg,1584,2154,1985207,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x0e10cb32654ada8d7c13328ee9428a8d2b5efa9f/1

15080,home,"this photo was taken in 2021, but it sat on my hard drive for a couple years and the final piece was finished on december 31, 2023.\nI had just visited family in alaska for the holidays, seeing everyone for the first time since 8 months prior. this visit got me thinking about my priorities, along with my relationships in life &#8211; whether those be familial, platonic, romantic, whatever.\nI missed feeling the way I did when I was back in my home town. a couple days after getting back to my somewhat new to me home in washington state, I stumbled upon this very simply drawn 4 panel comic illustration that I really loved.\nthe art was minimal, featuring a cat in one frame, and a scene of a room in the other 3. but the writing on it really resonated, it read:\n&#8220;it all seems very mundane\nbut one day\nyou&#8217;ll miss it\nwhen you see the photos&#8221;\nI think we have a tendency to take moments for granted while we&#8217;re actively living them, or maybe that&#8217;s just a me thing. this comic brought me to tears, though not necessarily tears of sadness &#8211; I was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude for the life that I&#8217;ve lived, the people I&#8217;ve met, the places I have been able to call home.\nI moved from knoxville, tennessee to washington state back in may 2023. my time in tennessee was tumultous, but I met some lovely people there, and shot this photo during a photo walk with my good friend avery.\nwhile this wasn&#8217;t where I actually lived, I think it in a way captures how I think of knoxville. it&#8217;s a group of apartment buildings, and the way the scene is tied together makes it feel very lived in. the children&#8217;s toys, the cat that I composited in (which was inspired by my childhood cat niko), the floral decoration outside the door closest to the left.\nI&#8217;ve never lived in this place, but it reminds me of all the places I&#8217;ve been able to call home, in a way representing how we choose the places we call home, and make them that way. the buildings pictured aren&#8217;t my home, but the photo itself is *all* of my homes.\n‚Äòhome‚Äô is a digital photo edited in adobe lightroom and photoshop.

15073,BATTLE ROYALE,"&#8220;The gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully.\nWhen your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes bring you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.&#8221;\nOscar Wilde\nDESCRIPTION:\nBATTLE ROYALE captures the fragility of youth against the backdrop of the eternal struggle between light and darkness. This painting depicts a scene where the vibrancy of youth is juxtaposed with the encroaching shadows of adversity, symbolizing the Greek mythological battle between the divine and the malevolent.\nThe left side of the canvas shows a god-like figure in the prime of youth, basked in a warm, radiant light that seems to emanate from within, representing the fire of life and the innocence of early years. The colors around this figure are soft and fluid, suggesting the malleability of young life, full of potential and yet vulnerable to the forces that surround it. The light, though bright, appears almost fragile, as if it could be snuffed out by the merest whisper of darkness.\nOn the right, the painting transitions to a darker, more ominous tone. A shadowy figure with wings spread wide dominates this half, to evoke a fallen angel or dark harbinger. The figure could represent the looming challenges and temptations that youth must navigate, a stark reminder of the perils that accompany the transition from innocence to experience.\nBetween these two realms, there is a tension, an interplay of light and shadow. Figures that appear younger and more vulnerable are cast in a chiaroscuro that accentuates their form, symbolizing the stark realities that youth must face as they step into the complexities of life. The sharp contrasts throughout the scene underscore the fleeting nature of youth, a transient dance between the joy of life&#8217;s beginnings and the sobering onset of maturity.\nThis artwork serves as a modern-day memento mori, urging the viewer to reflect on the transient beauty of youth and the inevitability of change, with a nod to the Greek understanding of life as a delicate balance between opposing forces.\n(50/50 AI + digital painting)\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HADAED.png,1160,2048,5595130,1of1s,Manifold,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0xf23ec6089866c82550550773d2174f74d0396812/1

15033,MLMB,"How will the construction of narratives unfold as our species coexists with new intelligences in emerging scenarios? What will be the link with the ancestral in an AI world?\nThe song title &#8216;MLMB&#8217; stands for MALAMBO, a dance originally attributed to the native cultures and former inhabitants of the Pampas and Patagonian regions of Argentina.\nThe dance is performed through Zapateo, composed of the movement of the feet and legs, as well as body posture, crucial for both balance and presence. Each combination of basic movements is unique and depends on who executes it. There are no rules for performing this dance. The order, position, coordination with music, and posture, as well as tempo can vary. In a similar way, this song reflects my approach to composition: there were no rules during the creative process.\nInspired by Argentinian women, MLMB holds personal relevance for me, as my great-great-grandmother belonged to the Tehuelche culture, who inhabited these mentioned regions of Argentinian territory. Lately, it has been a motivating force in exploring unknown family roots.\nIn the lyrics, there is a reference to dancing around the Cultrum. The Cultrum, or kultrun, is a ceremonial drum used by women both from the Mapuche and Tehuelche cultures. It is primarily employed by Machis (traditional medical figures) for religious and cultural rituals. In the Mapuche cosmology, the kultrun represents the universe, and the four cardinal points are represented on the drumhead. It is semi-spherical in shape, struck directly, and has a tightly stretched membrane attached. In this video, there is a piece jewelry symbolizing the cultrum.\nMLMB is all about strength and female energy. For me, there‚Äôs nothing fearless than women dancing Malambo. Inspired also by the Obsidian stone, this volcanic black stone (used by these cultures too), represents transpersonal force, cleansing, leads to the profound depths of the unconscious mind, and stimulates the addressing of the deepest fears. I hope the song encourages the same.\nMLMB constitutes a fragment of a broader art-and-science research project I&#8217;ve been working on‚Äîan audiovisual composition featuring 11 songs, aiming to express, expose, internalize, and reflect upon the current landscape of AI, neuroscience, human capabilities, and the relationships we build with these evolving intelligences.\nIf I win the prize, I would like to create a full-length video for the song JOYA 3. Currently, I have a DEMO version dropped in the collection of JOYA 3 (and also appears in link below), with the technology that the work deserves. In order to explore more deeply, and through professionally crafted scripts and video quality, the sensations evoked by a potential encounter and communicative exchange between a human and a hologram/digital image.\nI need to spotlight my project as I firmly believe it represents the optimal way to articulate the ideas I envision, and, most importantly, to communicate them in a manner that resonates with the audience. And also, keep supporting and give value to the musical community of which I am a part and taught me about this path as an artist.\nThe entire research and the complete work of art can be found in the following link, which includes the tracklist of the songs and overviews of the concept album.\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pnxNyvMcmJ76tsa6qx0tI5wpxFxO2frn?usp=drive_link \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MLMB-JOSHA.png,1800,2880,2762029,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x1b6e0a05c6f7b02a38f55c87e9c67c378e73b097

15019,Prelude,"‚ÄúPrelude‚Äù is a generative music and visual project created with Web Audio API and P5.js. I designed all of the synth sounds, and created the scheduling and random functions from scratch using Javascript and Web Audio API, constantly testing, listening and refining. The musical aspects are explained below. I had an idea for the visual to generate two random vertical waveforms and draw horizontal lines between them with colours adjusted depending on how far left or right the waves points were at that point from a full colour at one extreme point to white on the other to generate a gradient, and an illusion of depth and relief. From this starting point I introduced random elements, scrolling and random colours from a chosen palette.\nColour gradients are calculated from amplitudes of the randomly generated waveforms between a colour selected from a palette and white to create a corrugated effect which is then animated and the width is slightly warped to give it a fluid quality.\nAt the heart of &#8220;Prelude&#8221; is a musical component deeply rooted in improvisation, drawing inspiration from a game I devised for guitar practice. This game involves identifying specific permissible notes for each string, then playing a string pattern while choosing an appropriate note each time. In &#8220;Prelude&#8221;, this concept is brought to life through code. The program autonomously &#8216;plays&#8217; this improvisation game, solidifying a four-bar melody upon the piece&#8217;s minting, along with a fifth bar that serves as a &#8216;turnaround.&#8217; Alongside this, a drum pattern and an overarching structure are also established during the minting process. The drums are programmed to either play through certain bars, execute a drum fill, or remain silent, adding to the dynamic nature of the piece.\nThe piece is about change and constant, old and new, informed by a sense of play.

15007,Badguest,"&#8220;badguest&#8221; is more than just a song; it&#8217;s a sonic exploration of escapism and self-discovery. Conceived during the duo&#8217;s cross-country road trip, the track embodies the freedom of movement and the pursuit of one&#8217;s true self. The Vermont backdrop, with its serene landscapes, became a canvas for the duo to paint a musical narrative that encapsulates the essence of their journey.\nProcess:\nBroadwaves&#8217; creative process is deeply rooted in their nomadic spirit. The composition of &#8220;badguest&#8221; took shape during the duo&#8217;s sojourn in Vermont, where they found solace and inspiration amid nature&#8217;s beauty. Their vision draws parallels with the decentralized ethos of Web 3.0, where artists can break free from the constraints of Web 2.0&#8217;s centralized model.\nIn the studio, the artists utilized a diverse array of tools, reflecting their commitment to pushing sonic boundaries. Synthesizers, electronic instruments, and digital production techniques were employed to craft a multi-layered soundscape that captures the emotional depth of their journey.\nTools Used:\nBroadwaves&#8217; sonic arsenal includes a fusion of analog and digital tools, mirroring their eclectic influences. From synthesizers echoing Aphex Twin&#8217;s experimental ethos to digital production techniques inspired by Brian Eno&#8217;s ambient mastery, the duo leverages a broad palette to shape their sonic landscapes.\nVision about Web 3.0:\nIn response to the question about the concept and process, Broadwaves articulates a vision aligned with the principles of Web 3.0. They see art as a collaborative endeavor, and their perspective on &#8220;badguest&#8221; reflects a desire for artists to be free in a more collaborative environment. This vision challenges the centralized paradigm of Web 2.0, emphasizing a future where creators have greater agency and collaboration flourishes in a decentralized digital landscape.\nIn essence, Broadwaves&#8217; journey, both physical and artistic, embodies a vision of creative freedom and collaboration that resonates through their music and aligns with the evolving ethos of Web 3.0. &#8220;badguest&#8221; stands as a testament to their commitment to breaking boundaries and inviting listeners to explore the limitless possibilities of sound and self-discovery.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/badguest-image-2.png,1964,3024,1399068,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0xa91996d4a5772a22862cbbd5d6944b9ec2066432/1/

Hopeful for a new beginning, they discovered that the toxic dry expanses favored life underwater.\nThe planet&#8217;s waters teemed with biodiversity, and intelligent aquatic beings ruled beneath the waves. Humans, armed with unique space technology, created an underwater haven for life. However, without specialized suits, humans couldn&#8217;t survive in this environment.\nMira, the silent witness, understood that this marked the final chapter of human existence.

After this thorough process, I preselected 3 images from the pool of 90. I then wrote an initial text and juxtaposed it with each image as part of this presentation.

14982,All My Homies,"I have created two entirely new songs for this contest. The second is ‚ÄúAll My Homies,‚Äù an energetic, uplifting record about wanting to break out of the rat race of the traditional financial system to find financial freedom.\n‚ÄúAll my homies working for the man till we deceased / All my homies wanna do is live like we was free‚Äù\nFor many people, especially those from historically underrepresented communities, the promise of crypto is one of freedom. Not ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù as an abstract or politically charged buzzword, but freedom in the very tangible sense of financial independence, equal access and ownership, and the potential for building generational wealth. In the United States, Black people were intentionally and systematically prevented for generations from building wealth in the traditional financial system, and blockchain offers some hope of leveling the playing field. For many of us ‚Äî of all walks of life ‚Äî all we really want to do is escape from the rat race and be able to do something that genuinely excites us, like music.\nAt the same time, Web3 offers many promises for musicians, from reducing the influence of greedy intermediaries to allowing artists to connect more directly with their fanbases. The idiom that one only needs ‚Äú1,000 true fans‚Äù has never been more true. In fact, even just one or two truly committed NFT collectors could change an artist‚Äôs life overnight. And in return for their support, artists can give fans access to their careers in ways previously uncommon.\n‚ÄúAll My Homies‚Äù weaves both of these sentiments together. It is a song about wanting financial freedom, and seeking that freedom through music. The artwork, meanwhile, is an abstract graffiti homage to the homies, representing the core hip hop ethos of my approach to Web3.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/All-My-Homies-Art-Limited-4500-scaled.jpg,2560,2560,741874,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/maddopemadic/all-my-homies

The goal was to introduce &amp; onboard as many traditional artists into the web3 world.\nAll the money generated by this intervention and artwork will be equally shared by all artists involved, including any awards that might come from this submission. All the expenses related to this initiative (~6k euro) were supported fully supported by the Buzzed Bear DAO.\nOur focus was to collaborate with as many local artists as possible, so we patched four 100 by 150 cm canvas together to create a single 3 x 2 m canvas. This allowed plenty of space for multiple artists to do their thing.\nStarting with one of our Bears as a base (https://twitter.com/BuzzedBears/status/1730157530532155793), we gave no restrictions or directions on what artists should do. We wanted to see how each artist would interact with each other on canvas.\nWould they stay out of each other way? Or would they increment upon each others work. The end result is a layered piece, with a lot of texture, showcasing the destruction and rebirth of the Bear.\nWe couldn&#8217;t ask for a better lineup of web2 artists for this intervention, and we can&#8217;t really summarize their cultural impact in a few words so here is a description of each artist involved:\n&#8211; Hero de Janeiro (https://twitter.com/BuzzedBears/status/1733250102351794386)\nA street graffiti artist living in Amsterdam with works all over the world.\nHe is also known for his DJ mixing across the world too.

His DJ name then was The Dutch Master.\nSince then, Hero earned his ‚Äúde Janeiro‚Äù stripes for his time bringing Dutch techno music to Brazil in Rio, and also all over South America.\nBack in Holland he played 18 years as a resident DJ for the SupperClub, and still, he continued to tour the world, mixing quality techno.\nHe continues to mix and share his musical skills as Hero de Janeiro.

She has gained notoriety both as a performing artist in punk rock bands from the Amsterdam area, and as a visual artist with a strong personal style.\nBorn in 1983, Kiki Weerts first came to the attention as a band member of the punk rock band Malle Pietje en de Bimbo&#8217;s. They gained national attention through their eye-catching performance on the popular talk show &#8216;De Wereld Draait Door&#8217; in 2007.\nShe is now the songwriter, vocalist and guitarist of De Giletjes, an all-female trio of &#8220;lady punks from hell&#8221;, whose seventies-style punk rock is mixed with heavy metal and hints of the Dutch &#8220;sentimental songs&#8221; tradition.\nApart from musical activities, Kiki is also a visual artist. She is not only responsible of the visual style of De Giletjes, but also designs posters and album covers for other acts, as well as rock venues like Het Nieuwe Anita, OT301, Pacific Park, Het Patronaat, The Sugar Factory, Meubelstukken and Tivoli to name a few. Her paintings burst with imagery based on 1980s pop culture and science fiction.\nShe is also famous for her hand-painted leather and denim jackets, which are worn by some of the most prominent style icons of the Amsterdam fashion scene.\n&#8211; Job Reuten (https://twitter.com/BuzzedBears/status/1734699656926339569)\nJob is also the conceptual mind behind WIHH Gallery [https://buff.ly/46TxAgI ].\nBlessed with a happy desire for the unconventional, the actor, artist and event organizer Job Reuten channels his energy into freeing people from the confines of their everyday reality.\nThe same desire to shake things up by means of the unexpected characterizes his involvement in green initiatives all of which are underpinned by his conviction about the obligations of an artist: ‚ÄúI think artists should make stuff happen,‚Äù says Job. ‚ÄúWhile politicians blow hot air, we can generate buzz in action‚Äù he currently curates the WIHH Gallery and enables the journey of discovery for those curious enough to come into the door and witness 130+artists currently in exhibition.

In ‚ÄúStand up for your rights‚Äù working with upcycled materials, he gives a new life to art and materials that he finds, piecing them together into new visual forms.\nAs an advocate for peace and liberty he is a supporter and ambassador of the cannabis museum in Amsterdam with his art and his glasswork as a part of the museum and can be seen in many coffeeshops throughout the city as well.\nConsidering the Buzzed Bear Hideout community, it was a perfect collaborative fit. Disconnected from the digital side, his appearance and collaboration was unplanned yet welcomed; adding with this mix a note from a Druid reminiscent of the Asterix and Obelix comics scene.\n&#8211; Ahmed Manawishi (https://twitter.com/BuzzedBears/status/1729626426515521574)\nThe artistry raised from Egypt since 1972.

This multifaceted talent transpires in every medium used, having an unique perspective encapsulating an array of inspiration and resources.\n&#8211; Dim Balsem\nBecause the picture is worth a thousand words and it‚Äôs digitisation is also a big part of this web3 creative process, we asked this Amsterdam photographer to take part in this NFT collaboration.\nHe grew up in a little village called Nagele, designed by Gerrit Rietveld. The village is in the Northeast Polder, the first new dry laid land in the Netherlands, designed by engineer Cornelis Lely.\nBecause he grew up in a natural but designed environment, he probably established early in his creative live, his love for external influence on human nature.\nDim was accepted at the royal academy in Hague and finished the academy in 2009. His main interest became photography.\nDim has an associative, raw and sleek mixed style, where being distanced and being a part of, are two significant coexisting themes. As are natural and artificial. His main approach is to always try to trigger curiosity and jolt himself.\nHe makes associative iconic photo documentary work depicting masculinity, Femininity, self reflection, beauty and personality. He works with the International Theater Amsterdam and is often documenting nature expeditions all over the world.\nThis piece features multiple different styles, from stencil, graffiti, hand painting, brush painting, &amp; paint splashing.\nUnfortunately we couldn&#8217;t gather many bids on the final piece, but our main goal was accomplished: We onboarded 8 influential artists into the web3 world, where the frontier of art is happening today. This prize would allow us to show these artists that web3 is a sustainable avenue for selling their artworks &amp; organize more events like this in the future.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BBHxWIHH-copy-2.png,1280,851,2758338,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xccc5e5ee65925c4769d91690925c891897296f48/1

This collection serves as a contemplative reflection on the resurgence of indigenous arts and cultural practices, which have not only contributed to increased exports but have also inspired innovative solutions from Nigerian thinkers, fusing traditional and contemporary elements.\nThroughout &#8220;Wings of Revival,&#8221; symbols such as the traditional Adire fabric, the Afonfo flower, cowrie shells, and spices are used to illustrate the synergistic dynamic between tradition and modernity. The butterfly serves as a symbol of the transformation and evolution of Nigerian culture and its economy. The wing patterns are inspired by the iconic Adire fabric, a traditional wax and patterned textile prepared by the Yoruba people. A variety of cowrie shell species- including purple top and spotted cowrie shells. They are incorporated into the head and body of the butterfly to highlight the historical use of cowrie shells as currency and their continued significant role in traditional cultural practices and artwork.\nThe background features the Afonfo flower, also known as Butterfly Pea flower, which can be found throughout Nigeria.

The islanders were so affected by this incident that some nights they claimed to hear the screams of children coming from the orphanage.\nJust before i took the photo; in this area where many cows were crowded, this cow, walking alone with its head bowed down, apart from the crowd, seemed to carry feelings from the past of that place. In its loneliness, it seemed to carry the silent cries of all those poor children who had no one, who were dragged from place to place during the war years, and perhaps even the innocent children who burned and suffocated in that terrible fire. \nAs soon as I saw this cow, I wanted to create a retrospective of the tragic past of this region and I photographed this lonely creature with my 35mm film camera.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/000044-scaled.jpg,1704,2560,1186647,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xcee85f0d07fa18b457d0db35cfff98b4e2efdcf2/1

14916,Singularity Series :: Supernova,"&#8220;Like the birth of the universe itself, every image in the Singularity Series is born from a chaotic explosion of particles and energy &#8211; emanating from a single point in space and time.&#8221;\nI was originally inspired by the idea of what it might be like to capture the Big Bang using long exposure photography techniques. Every image in the series is generated from the same source code, with subtle variations in the parameters applied to the system. I was particularly interested in the intersection between physics simulations, generative art, and multipass rendering techniques when this series was created.\nI learned to code in Java using a framework called Processing &#8211; a type of visual sketchbook for programmers. The Singularity Series&#8217; generative system combines physics modeled using Verlet Integration and was conceptually inspired by String theory. These &#8220;strings&#8221; or &#8220;strands&#8221; act as springs, subject to the external and internal forces applied to them.\nMultiple strands are anchored to the global origin ( think center of the universe ). Forces of attraction and repulsion are applied to each strand, and the resulting system is rendered using a multipass rendering approach. The final image is a composite of multiple render passes, or animation frames, using additive blending and techniques similar to long-exposure photography. Each image in the series is a visual history of the emergent behaviour of all the particles in the system over time, with different parameters applied to each scenario.\nThe source code for the original sketch is available here: https://pastebin.com/BUyrcrWc\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hairball-still-131.jpeg,720,1280,195597,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x87669d2a3dbae4f2aa81953ae0200aea9445210a

14912,Memento Mori,"&#8220;Memento Mori&#8221; is a personal note to my darker side, my alter ego.\nI firmly believe that each of us carries a mix of good and bad within; absolute purity is unrealistic. What truly matters is which side we allow to take over. There may have been times when our darker selves won the battle. I know mine did.\nThe song serves as a testament to my journey toward self-redemption‚Äîa message from me to my other self. Writing the line &#8220;Why should I be paying for your crimes?&#8221; felt like a declaration of war against living a life imprisoned by my own darkness. It&#8217;s unfair to claim that it defines who I am; it might be who I can become, but it&#8217;s not my core identity.\nThe Latin phrase &#8220;Memento mori&#8221; means &#8220;remember that you will die&#8221;. That&#8217;s why the last lines of the chorus really capture the heart of the song: &#8220;All&#8217;s memento mori/ So it&#8217;s time for me to finally be alive&#8221;. It&#8217;s a reminder that as long as there&#8217;s even a single drop of life, death can&#8217;t take over. The worst within us cannot triumph as long as we preserve the light.\nOnce I finished writing and composing the melody, Satwik and I started producing the song. I had a very dark yet experimental vision and with Satwik&#8217;s expertise in Pop, we ended up with a very unique style.\nThe song started when Satwik and I were apart, me in Romania and Satwik in India, but after a few months, I visited him and we finished the track. Releasing it on-chain before streaming platforms was a good strategy as it helped me gain strong supporters who can later help me make this song big on social media (by sharing and interacting) or streaming!\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Memento_Mori_Cover.thumb_.png,3000,3000,1530206,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/brenda/memento-mori

As a classical musician of the Cape Philharmonic\nYouth orchestra that performed at the Artscape, I feel that it is still necessary to\npay tribute to those who were left to imagine the music, which this privilege\nproduces.\nThe title Ghost notes thus refers to the denial of experiencing the full value of the\nperformance that I seasonally produce with the orchestra and the generational\ntrauma that haunts those who think on this personal narrative. Crucially, this\ntitle further derives its force from the technical understanding of a ghost note,\nwhich is understood in music, as a note that is usually played softly without any\npitch. Thus the Ghost note draws attention to a certain moment of pause.\nMoreover, I&#8217;m excited about decentralized technology and the lack of boundaries available for budding artists. This ties hand-in-hand with the exact concept I&#8217;m working with, where so much talent has been gatekept for various reasons. For the first time, artists have the ability to full express themselves regardless of any arbitrary labels.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image0.jpeg,1600,1200,359773,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xb596301a9bad9c212d509be4d63804dca8c0060c

14907,Nostalgia For String Orchestra,"The form and tone of the piece is free. In this work, the violin along with the viola are depicting the process of my life, moving on other instruments, and the chords by the cello adds to the anxiety of the work, each time shakes the image of my life and the peak of my despair and loneliness with all the ups and downs. I was carrying a violin, which with its interaction with the viola seems to show my connection with my life from years ago&#8230; Every time the song ends, I sink into the being and not being of the past and the silence covers me involuntarily, like in Hitchcock&#8217;s movies. Although he believed that his movies were nothing more than comedies, but this is the same fluid issue that showed me that there are no heroes in my life, but characters. I imagine the moment when a woman is taking a bath, a knife rises from behind the curtain, and a scream that is synchronized with the climax of the violin. What I want to say is short, the violin, the waves, the scream, the rhythm, the tempo, and all the elements that connected me with my memories were only a sign of one thing, the nostalgia of my life in sync with the violin, and finally, like a Hitchcock trick, the same voice again. Nostalgia shakes my memories and finds itself in the same look&#8230;\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cover-5.png,1024,1024,1436155,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xa9e2117c52c77c84d7ed7fa6756ca7c14572de86/1
14902,The Abyss of the Human Condition,"This art delves into the darker facets of human nature. At the center sits a man, the embodiment of collected composure amidst the chaos, his face a mask of indifference to the turmoil around him. Surrounding him is a nightmarish vision of humanity&#8217;s vices: from the twisted visages that represent deceit and hate, to the macabre scenes of violence and cruelty. Each figure and object is a surreal embodiment of evils like prejudice, selfishness, and the insidious creep of hate speech. With a backdrop that evokes a world torn asunder by these sins, the painting offers a stark reminder of the consequences of moral decay. This piece is not just an artistic expression but a mirror, urging introspection about the societal ills that pervade our world and how they shape the human psyche.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bad-Nature.png,1024,1024,2046759,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xdf0c7b64f7184d5899542de64c632e57b221ab1a/premint-1

14896,Infinite and finite,"NFT is a technology that gives uniqueness to digital data, which used to be easy to duplicate; NFT guarantees the uniqueness of digital data, but the metadata associated with NFT is still easy to duplicate.\nWhile analog data is difficult to duplicate because of the time, effort, and technology required, digital data can be easily duplicated in a theoretically unlimited number of copies without the time, effort, and technology required. Using the characteristics of digital data (infinite), which is easy to replicate, and NFT (finite), which brings uniqueness to digital data, works are represented using NFT metadata that has been replicated in large quantities. Although the work expressed in this way is the original and unique, its constituent elements are works (digital data) created by others. The uniqueness of each work (digital data) is guaranteed by NFT, but does the uniqueness of each individual work really exist in this work? Is there any finiteness in the infinity of NFT metadata that has been massively replicated? And is there any originality in works created based on replication?\nIn this work, we used the works of &#8220;We Love the Art&#8221; submitted as NFT art, as well as replication of representative existing famous NFT works. The work also uses a &#8220;mandala&#8221;, a religious symbol and meditation tool used mainly in Buddhism, which symbolizes the infinity of the universe and spirituality, as a compositional device. By using the contrasting characteristics of infinity and finitude in digital data and incorporating them into a single NFT work, this work questions what uniqueness and originality mean in the context of digital data.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ÁÑ°È°å7_20240109044313.png,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xdda86d673dae344f3c22210b2054154d9b4813c8/2?referrer=0xdfbD73017e1C50B5D0BA6fC2bA7e9F96fF4262a1

14892,Relic: Data Threads,"&#8216;Relic&#8217; unveils a novel visual language of carpet patterns, born from the synergy of artist and machine. Mammadov&#8217;s project utilizes GAN algorithms to analyze visual patterns in an extensive carpet pattern archive, meticulously compiled over seven years. This interaction of artist and AI yields unique, yet reminiscent designs. Mammadov&#8217;s approach, ceding partial control to the machine, probes into themes of cultural appropriation and the erosion of deep-rooted traditions in our globalized milieu. Simultaneously, he reasserts ownership within a modern framework, redefining these patterns as symbols of a bygone era.\nExpanding the scope of these patterns, Mammadov moves beyond traditional carpet weaving to embrace computational systems adept at discerning patterns in data. Historical carpet designs thus transform into digital data threads. Mammadov perceives these as crucial informational vessels, reflecting societal narratives, blurring the lines between fine art and craft through technological interpretation. The physical aspects of screens and machine learning are emphasized by the visible, entangled wires behind them. These wires not only expose the artwork&#8217;s inner workings but also echo the authenticity markers found in real carpets, known through their knots.\nMammadov&#8217;s latest innovation integrates this conceptual framework with a practical application. He has created a trail using particle simulation in Houdini, drawing inspiration from GAN-generated videos of carpet patterns. This results in a carpet-like thread or trail simulation, which is informed by the GAN carpet patterns. This addition to his repertoire symbolizes the convergence of digital artistry with traditional motifs, further exploring the intersection of technology and cultural heritage.\n&#8216;Relic&#8217;, therefore, transcends traditional cultural understanding, reshaping it through the prism of societal evolution. It presents alternate futures, bridging history with contemporary communication methods, heralding a new era of cross-cultural exchange through technology. In &#8216;Relic&#8217;, the ancient and the modern converge, mutually reinventing and enriching each other&#8217;s narrative.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DataCarpet_HairSim_v04-2.00_00_49_21.Still001.png,1080,1920,4442338,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x0e02ba482bc6c911fdfd7562cf890083227d6b1c/2

14867,Boohoo,"Boo Hoo started in my room, on my keyboard, late one quarantine night. I was living with my band at the time and since we just had to cancel our next European tour, due to the lockdown, my usual busy fast paced life had come to a screeching halt. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I had also just broken up with my boyfriend of 3 years and was in the depths of despair with no clue how I was going to resurface. I had been spending many nights at my keyboard therapeutically trying to work through my pain, and this particular night the words and melody came out effortlessly. The first verse and chorus to Boohoo appeared within a few minutes and my tear soaked journal started drying as I got a moment of relief and excitement from a cool new song idea. I spent the next day writing the second verse, fined tuned some lyrics and then played it for my bandmate, who then helped me make a demo of it.\nI have been a part of many projects, mostly all collaborations in some respect, but Boohoo turned out to the be the first song I had written completely all by myself. So just for that I am proud. As for the track production, I enlisted the talents of my F√≠ance! Yes, you heard that right. and some amazing musicians, who helped bring my song to life. There is a sweet juxtaposition of heartbroken lyrics over a more upbeat classic soul rhythm section, making even the most painful situation have a positive spin. I have found the most growth comes out of the hardest situations. I grew so much from this heartbreak and have luckily found myself on the complete other side, so happy, in love, and content in my own skin. It&#8217;s always beautiful when a painful time can be transformed into healing art, and my hope is that, with all my music, it will give others support on their own journeys.\nThe image I chose was shot on film by Amanda Lopez. I am silhouetted by the desert sky, but you can&#8217;t tell whether it is dusk or dawn. When you&#8217;re in the trenches of a challenging time, it&#8217;s hard to know if it&#8217;s getting better or worse, lighter or darker, and this image represents just that. \nI know quarantine was a while ago, so I have been sitting with this song for a few years, but it started me on my solo journey and I have since written so many more songs. I&#8217;m excited to bring this one onchain to document this new beginning.

14863,Mignon,"Mignon\n(pronounced meen-YON)\nThis song is my Krautrock (psychedelic rock, avant-garde composition, and electronic music) adaptation of a classic German Lied by composer Robert Schumann and set to text by German romantic writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nInspiration:\n&#8211; Kennst du das Land?, (Wilhelm Meister songs for voice &amp; piano), Op. 98a/1 &#8211; by Robert Schumann, published in 1849\n&#8211; Wilhelm Meister&#8217;s Apprenticeship &#8211; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1795‚Äì96\nWhen I trained to be an opera singer at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada and at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, Austria, I performed this piece.\nIn Goethe&#8217;s novel, the protagonist, Wilhelm Meister, journeys across Bavaria and undergoes self-realization. Along his travels, he encounters a young girl named Mignon, who wistfully sings for her homeland.\nIn the text, there are certain lyric poems included that add to the narrative. One of these is a twelve-line poem, a single stanza, known as Mignon&#8217;s Lied. Goethe meant for it to be sung, and composers of that era were quickly drawn to it. Some of the most renowned composers of the nineteenth century were among those who crafted musical settings for it. This is my own modern interpretation of it.\nMy version incorporates elements of not only the classical version, but also influences from Gypsy jazz music when I sang with Romani Gypsies in their caravans in France. Driving basslines, alternating rhythmic meters, manipulated Gypsy jazz guitar, and sweeping synths express the nostalgia, angst, and hope of the protagonist Mignon as she sings for her homeland.\nI co-produced this song with Daniel Lynas and Alex Dadras, multi-platinum producers for A$AP Rocky.\nTo write this song, I translated the German text to English, made a few adjustments to modernize the text, and cut a lot of the text since it would&#8217;ve stretched for quite a long time. I wanted the song to fit in a modern pop time frame of roughly 3 minutes, so I got that red pen out to edit and cut away.\nIf you want to geek out with me, listen to the very beginning descending piano line in Schumann&#8217;s song in this beautiful rendition of the original classical version with soprano Dawn Upshaw singing and Richard Goode playing piano: https://bit.ly/schumannmignon\nThen check out the bridge of my song at 2:40.

Colors transition smoothly, their gradients highlighting the nuanced cadences of a heartbeat, each shift a whisper of life&#8217;s rich tapestry.\nIn this creation, I invite viewers to pause, to breathe, to sync with the artwork&#8217;s gentle rhythm. It&#8217;s a digital reflection of our heartbeat, a reminder of the quiet yet powerful life force within us all. Here, meditation transcends silence, becoming a luminous journey through the layers of our being.\nIn creating &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat,&#8221; I found myself drawn into the emotional depths of Mark Rothko&#8217;s canvases, the surreal landscapes of Dreamcore, and the perpetual motion intrinsic to Kinetic Art.\nRothko&#8217;s work taught me the power of colors to evoke feeling, and in my piece, I sought to channel that same raw emotion through gradients and glow, inviting viewers to experience a heartbeat&#8217;s intimate rhythm.\nThe peculiar, dreamlike quality of Dreamcore subtly infused my work with its pink hues and translucent oddities, lending it an otherworldly charm that blurs the lines between the strange and the familiar, the real and the imagined.\nAnd from Kinetic Art, I embraced the essence of movement. Each digital strand in &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; seems to breathe and sway, engaging viewers in a silent conversation about our place in a world where technology and organic life are increasingly intertwined.\nThis artwork is a personal narrative, a piece of my soul rendered in digital form. It stands as a reflection of life&#8217;s pulsations, a heartbeat within the binary beat of our time.\nThe creation of &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; began with a simple sphere in MODO, symbolizing potential and the start of life&#8217;s rhythm. This sphere, the artwork‚Äôs core, was soon layered with fur, giving it a lifelike texture. Two types of fur were used: one thick and protective, the other fine and floating, creating a contrast that added depth and movement.\nThe material of the sphere itself was refined to have a reflective and translucent quality, resembling a living membrane. This allowed the sphere to interact with its environment, reflecting and absorbing light, giving it a subtle inner glow.\nColor in this piece arose from the play of light, the sphere‚Äôs surface, and its innate luminosity, yielding a palette that‚Äôs rich and complex. The final colors, complex due to the translucency, add to the piece‚Äôs organic feel.\n&#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; is a digital sculpture that seems to pulse with life. It is a visual echo of the rhythms that sustain us, capturing the essence of a heartbeat within a delicate, living membrane.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xdfd5ee29276cd57535a826cdcced31bce7d34a41/1

14853,Garden Of Prometheus,"The Garden of Prometheus story\nAfter creating humanity, Prometheus gifts them a garden of roses along with fire. After passing through a threshold, people wander in this garden, creating a bouquet of red roses and, reaching the white rose at the end of the garden, disappear as they touch it. Some of them, despite taking a long time to slowly tour the garden, have a bouquet in their hands with very similar roses, while others, in a short time, move towards the white rose but hold a bouquet consisting of various roses. Some gather these roses joyfully, while others constantly rush and hastily collect them. Despite these different behaviors, they all wear a yellow raincoat. When it rains, they tightly embrace this raincoat and try to protect themselves from the merciless rain. On sunny days, they rejoice at the radiant yellow color of this raincoat. The bouquet made up of all the roses had a different beauty and was of great value to them.\nThe entire garden was covered with these beautiful roses, but as one approached the white rose at the end of the garden, the roses began to wither, and the path became increasingly arid. Nevertheless, everyone seeing that white rose would go towards it, eager to touch it. The white withered rose, the last piece to complete the bouquet, was neither as colorful nor as beautiful as the other roses, but each person could not help but be drawn to its extraordinary attraction. And when they finally touched the rose, they would suddenly vanish. With their disappearance, new roses would bloom in the garden, and immediately afterward, a new person would come through the gateway with a light, and the cycle would repeat continuously. Thus, the garden would grow and become more beautiful over time.\nThe Garden of Prometheus nft detailed descriptions\nRed Roses:\nEach red rose symbolizes lived moments and experiences. As the individual walks through the garden, picking flowers, memories, and experiences accumulate. Life is comprised of the bouquet of flowers we gather, and as simple as it is, it is beautiful. The flowers people collect are personal and, therefore, the most valuable flowers are the ones they gather themselves.\nFigure Wearing a Yellow Raincoat:\nThis figure represents humanity; the raincoat is yellow, symbolizing the hope for sunny, beautiful days. At the same time, it signifies the fear of rainy, dark weather, and the desire to protect oneself from bad days. People should remember that for the most beautiful flowers to bloom, they need both sunlight and rain. Thus, individuals gain experiences, and the value of beautiful memories is realized.\nWithered White Rose at the End of the Path:\nThe withered white rose at the end of the path symbolizes the end of human life. It is a faded white tulip because white flowers represent both beginnings and farewells. Just like death signifies a farewell and a new beginning for the individual.\nCircle Formed by the Flowers:\nThe roses, along with their stems, form a circle towards the white rose, symbolizing the cycle of life. As they move towards the white rose, their vitality diminishes, and they wither. New roses bloom from among them, representing the constant renewal of life.\nWhite Back of the Human Figure and the Gateway:\nThe white back of the figure represents the past and time. It moves forward with the individual and cannot be turned back. As the person walks, their past also accompanies them. It symbolizes that life is lived only once, and once lived, it cannot be undone. The gateway represents human life and birth.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WhatsApp-Image-2024-01-09-at-00.16.02.jpeg,1015,1037,92060,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xb88be7ac909f63205d03a8b90025438fa2898a1a/1?referrer=0x00Bd0C2b9eD7418b32a3a11B6a2348ebD8bE2dE0

This artwork embodies the philosophy of art as a meta-discipline, intertwining elements of history, philosophy, nature, and science. It uses stable diffusion to animate traditional miniature paintings, a nod to UNESCO&#8217;s heritage art forms, then transforms these animations into a dynamic, sand-shaped particle simulation in a Houdini system, utilizing over one million particles. Each particle, representing a pixel of the animation, contributes to a fluid, evolving artwork. This project is not just a tribute to the ancient art of miniatures but a bold step into the realm of digital art, where silicon and code breathe new life into old traditions, bridging diverse civilizations and eras. Mammadov&#8217;s work stands as a testament to the power of art in fostering cultural exchange and narrating history, inviting viewers to delve into our shared heritage through these reimagined miniature masterpieces.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/muraqqadune.jpg,1920,1080,1052628,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x0e02ba482bc6c911fdfd7562cf890083227d6b1c/1

There have been many popular shiba coins and art out there. The most popular meme coins I have seen all involve shibas. From shiba inu, to doge, to dogwifhats just to name a few.\nFor that reason my ai art was focused on Shibas. My idea was to use dreamstudio.ai to help create a surreal image of a large Shiba Inu being almost worshipped. It stands at the top of everything, I made sure that no other living thing was above the shiba and made sure that the pathway of stairs led to this enormous dog, representing just how all paths lead to Shiba. If you notice closely at the Shibas face you&#8217;ll see that its slightly smirking, and that the people in the audience are like clones with one another. It shows how no matter what meme coin is created it always leads to Shiba Inu being on top.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sh.png,1024,1024,2085272,1of1s,"Mint.fun,Stability AI",https://mint.fun/op/0x7e117522F487Ab1D45b64063156DbB9c70745C9b?ref=0x93b74C3FA5B434BaC3a25AF70F39C7365998c062

14835,The Chaos,"This project was completed without any editing or effects, only with a Canon EOS 250D digital camera, using a long exposure technique to emphasize the light details and taking photos (5 photos), combining them together and creating a gif.\nDark means uncertainty to me. And the noise is confusion and disturbance. The combination of these two keywords (dark&amp;noise) brings the theme of &#8216;chaos&#8217; to life in my head. Chaos, which has the meaning of turmoil, is interpreted with different expressions too. Like &#8216;Chaos is the state of the universe before it came into orderly, and far from form and straight, incompatible and confused&#8217;. The state of the universe before it came into order is too vague for a human will, just like darkness. And it&#8217;s just like the noise that this disorder brings.\nSo, in short, I have defined chaos as a concept.\nIn the first and the third photo, the beams of light symbolizes a group of people. It represents a never-ending crowd around us, and the never-ending uncertainty, how tiring of this crowd, how this chaos that tires us in our lives that flows so fast looks from a far.\nSecondly, there is not only a view from a far in the gif. As can be seen from the photo transitions, it seems that the cat lived when it witnessed the chaos very closely, now it is overwhelmed by the chaos that is happening, and now it just stands calmly and watches what is happening. In fact, this cat represents everyone who is sufficiently overwhelmed by the crowd and chaos and is drawn into his own state.\nFinally, if we examine the sixth photo of the collection, we see the outside world, from the point of view where the cat character, who is seen fleeing from chaos and stopping in the gif, pulls himself back from all this crowd and watches what is happening, and through his eyes.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gifFINAL9MB.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x2fee58b13606b37b80270de2001c09fdc8af2e6a/premint-1

14828,Just You,"‚ÄúJust You‚Äù combines the harmonic colors of Gypsy jazz guitar, a steady beating pulse, psychedelic synth lines, and a bass line that explores and inverts a musical theme on the upright bass. My lyrics recall shared memories of intimate moments and vulnerabilities with my ex. Solo guitar passages run parallel to a Moog Voyager synthesizer‚Äôs ascending line with a filter sweep that opens up the sound, signifying my raw expression of truth.\nThe bird theme plays through, as both of our last names are the names of birds; mine: Alouette; his: Cardinal. The lyrics about the pistol lying on the window were inspired by a moment when I worked on a French vineyard and ch√¢teau. One morning I went to the kitchen window and found a pistol there. At first, I thought there was a secret James Bond-esque situation going on in the grand estate. I later learned it was for shooting at pigeons to scare them from the turrets in the ch√¢teau walls. The haunting chorus, ‚ÄúJust you and I‚Äù (inspired by a moment from the film ‚ÄòTwin Peaks‚Äô), repeats as our love washes away through the beachy marshes where we created memories.\nJUST YOU MUSIC VIDEO\nWatch the music video: http://bit.ly/AlarkeJustYou\nThe ‚ÄúJust You‚Äù music video fuses cutting-edge electronic beats with flavors of Gypsy jazz guitar and psychedelic synth lines.

These live-generated, colorful beams of light were custom-designed to react to every inflection and intonation of voice and musical instruments &#8212; at the very moment that they happen.

14825,BINARY COSMOS: Choreographed 01,"&#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; embodies the &#8216;Dance of Chaos and Order,&#8217; reflecting the ever-shifting balance between stability and unpredictability in the cosmos and digital world. The moving binary digits represent the unpredictable nature of digital data against the orderly backdrop of the universe, highlighting the contrast between the structured cycles of celestial bodies and the randomness of the digital realm.\nThe artwork also transforms into a space for digital meditation. The zeroes and ones, swirling in their harmonious yet unpredictable patterns, invite viewers into a contemplative state, echoing the immersive experience of our digital lives. This modern meditation, set amidst a galaxy of binary code, offers a tranquil escape, moving away from traditional settings to the heart of the digital realm. &#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; becomes a nexus of peace and introspection, merging the digital with the spiritual for a unique, reflective experience.\nAs the creator of &#8220;Binary Cosmos: The Dance of Zeroes and Ones,&#8221; my journey through the realms of digital art has been deeply influenced by a blend of artistic movements and visionary artists. The conceptual depth of Sol LeWitt, who championed the idea over the physical form, resonates with my approach to art. In &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; I sought to transcend the visual, using binary code not just as a medium, but as a metaphor for our digitized existence, echoing LeWitt&#8217;s emphasis on concept.\nThe kinetic energy and movement within my work draw inspiration from the dynamism of Kinetic Art, where each animated binary digit mirrors the fluidity of the digital age. This movement is a dialogue with the viewer, reflecting the ever-changing nature of data and technology, much like the living sculptures of Kinetic Art. Additionally, the influence of Pop Art, particularly the mass-production techniques of Andy Warhol, is evident in the creation process. Utilizing modern 3D software, I replicated the binary elements across the spherical canvas, akin to Warhol&#8217;s silkscreen printing, but in the digital realm. The vibrant color scheme, reminiscent of Pop Art&#8217;s playful aesthetic, bridges the gap between the viewer&#8217;s everyday digital interactions and the art, making &#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; not just a visual experience but a culturally relevant piece.\nIn creating &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; I aimed to capture the essence of these artistic movements, intertwining them with the innovative spirit of Thomas Heatherwick&#8217;s Seed Cathedral. The artwork is a reflection of the complexities and nuances of the digital world, a space where conceptual depth, kinetic energy, and pop culture converge, creating a unique narrative about the relationship between humanity and the ever-evolving digital landscape.\nIn the creation of &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; the artist initiated with a simple ball in MODO, a 3D software, shaping it into a globe upon which binary codes would perform their virtual dance. This sphere symbolized unity and set the stage for the unfolding digital narrative.\nIn a move that highlights the innovative spirit of the artist, the original ball and the two binary shapes were then hidden, allowing the replicated digits to stand on their own, populating the spherical space with their presence. This act of concealment is emblematic of the crypto art narrative, where the underlying structure is just as important as the visible outcome.\nThe creative process embraced randomness within set boundaries, a dance between artist control and digital serendipity. Defined coordinates and rotations granted each binary figure a distinct identity, yet their final arrangement and interaction were left to chance, reflecting the cosmic interplay of order and chaos.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo_2024-01-08-13.41.05.jpeg,1280,1264,101422,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x53d0798c0aa32d607eaed93a5f27c716614d4fa7/2

14800,·ºàŒΩœÑŒ∑œáŒø·ø¶œÉŒ± ŒìŒ±·øñŒ±: An Audiovisual Symphony of Planetary Health,"This submission is a dynamic installation that uses real-time environmental data to create an evolving audiovisual experience. It employs five key environmental indicators: Methane Level, CO2 Level, Nitrous Oxide Level, Global Temperature Anomaly, and Global Sea Level. These data points received through open source APIs are integrated with a system of five oscillators, each uniquely reacting to a specific environmental factor.\nCO2 Levels: These are linked to the frequency and tempo of a sawtooth oscillator. As CO2 concentrations rise, the sound produced becomes increasingly discordant, reflecting environmental imbalance.\nMethane Levels: These affect the frequency and tempo of a square wave arpeggiator. Higher methane levels result in more pronounced disharmony.\nGlobal Temperature Anomaly: This data influences the frequency and amplitude envelope of a triangle oscillator, introducing rhythm disruptions and further discordance as temperature anomalies increase.\nNitrous Oxide Levels: These are tied to a frequency modulator that controls the pitch and amplitude of all oscillators. Rising nitrous oxide levels degrade the overall signal, symbolising environmental degradation.\nGlobal Sea Level: This parameter modulates a noise generator. As sea levels rise, the noise amplitude increases, eventually overwhelming the other sounds, representing the drowning of the ecosystem.\nAdditionally, an aggregate of all these data sets is calculated to modify the tempo and musical scales used by the oscillators. The piece transitions from the Dorian mode on one end of the spectrum, associated with simplicity, through all the musical modes (including some Japanese modes) all the way to the more complex and unresolved Locrian mode on the other end of the spectrum, symbolising increasing environmental distress.\nVisually, the installation hosted and live rendered on acrb.world features a digital representation of the Earth. Initially resembling primordial life, this digital sphere reacts to the audio output, morphing and distorting in response to the changing sound waves, much like ferrofluid reacts to magnetic fields. The more the environmental data indicates imbalance, the more distorted the Earth&#8217;s representation becomes, potentially leading to a depiction of complete ecological collapse.\nIn this dynamic audiovisual installation, we utilize Max/MSP to generate a primitive sphere geometry, rendered through the &#8216;jitter gridshape object&#8217;. This forms the basis for our interactive representation, where environmental data and waveforms profoundly influence the visual output. Key elements such as vertices and textures are derived from this process and subsequently enhanced through a noise generator.\nThe CO2 levels, intricately linked with a sawtooth oscillator, play a pivotal role in shaping the visual dynamics. By multiplying the coefficient of the CO2 level with the frequency (x) and amplitude (z) of the sawtooth oscillator, we achieve a nuanced visual representation. Similarly, the Global Temperature Anomaly, associated with a triangle wave, is integrated using the same parameters to reflect its impact.\nFurthermore, the interaction of Methane levels with a square wave arpeggiator introduces additional complexity. Here, the amplitude (x) is influenced by the Methane levels, while the frequency (z) is a function of the arpeggiator, creating a distinct visual pattern.\nCrucially, the aggregate of all environmental data sets is employed to multiply across the entire system, amplifying the noise and deformation. This results in a more pronounced and impactful visual representation that correlates with the combined environmental stressors. In essence, this installation not only captures the essence of environmental data through sound but also manifests it visually, creating a compelling, immersive experience that highlights the critical interplay between our environment and technological interpretation.\nWhilst the token always represents the current state of the Earth&#8217;s health, here are two renders of either end of the spectrum (healthy and dying) that showcase the scope of the installation, our planet&#8217;s vitality, and the effects of humanity&#8217;s impact on Gaia.\nThriving: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffCMVfrdCgFu_itPM_E240A3bahatxoL/view?usp=drive_link\nDying: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N0dUDVGCZboK2az7NUUsSEIq32srE_GO/view?usp=drive_link\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://opensea.io/assets/base/0x1ac85c299ab35e3dd768f39ca76ba1bac56d28f5/1

14753,I combine the reality of Katana with Art.,"Forging Tradition into the Digital Realm: Transforming Katana Craftsmanship into NFT Art\nIn a world where pixels meet steel, the ancient craft of katana-making finds an unlikely yet captivating intersection with the digital canvas. As a katana artisan, I&#8217;ve embarked on a journey to immortalize my blades not just in physical form but also as unique pieces of digital art through the revolutionary medium of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\nThe Confluence of Tradition and Technology:\nThe process begins in the heart of my traditional forge, where I meticulously craft each katana with the same dedication that has defined generations of swordsmiths. Every strike of the hammer and dance of the flames contributes to the soul of the blade. Once the physical masterpiece is complete, it&#8217;s time to embark on the digital transformation.\nCapturing the Essence:\nPhotography becomes a crucial part of the process as I document every angle, curve, and detail of the katana. The goal is to capture not just the physical attributes but also the essence and spirit that reside within the blade. High-resolution images ensure that the digital representation does justice to the craftsmanship.\nDigitizing the Soul:\nThe next step involves transforming these images into digital files, creating a virtual twin of each katana. This requires precision to maintain the authenticity of the original work. The digital files become the basis for the NFT, ensuring that each token is a true representation of the tangible artistry.\nBlockchain Alchemy:\nEntering the world of NFTs means embracing blockchain technology. Each katana artwork is tokenized, creating a unique, verifiable, and irreplaceable digital asset. The blockchain ensures transparency, traceability, and security, essential elements for the integrity of the digital representation of my craft.\nThe NFT Marketplace:\nOnce tokenized, the digital katana art finds its home in NFT marketplaces. Here, collectors and enthusiasts can appreciate, bid on, and purchase these digital treasures. The ownership and authenticity of each digital katana are securely embedded in the blockchain, providing a decentralized and tamper-proof record.\nPreserving Legacy in the Digital Age:\nBy turning katana craftsmanship into NFT art, I aim to bridge the gap between tradition and the digital frontier. It&#8217;s a means of preserving the legacy of this ancient art form, making it accessible to a global audience. The digital katana not only becomes a representation of the tangible blade but also a unique piece of art with its own digital identity.\nIn this digital metamorphosis, the katana transcends its physical constraints, becoming a symbol of artistic innovation in the ever-evolving landscape of NFT art.

14743,Digital Bath,"What does it look like when electricity runs through water?\nDigital Bath is an abstract, blocky, colorful, glitchy, chaotic representation of this idea. An endless flow of pixelated electrons washes over you as it randomly jumps from idea to idea. Each frame is divided into layers of alternating lines. These lines separate into different length blocks, and a group of algorithms are selected to determine when each block is visible. It is the combination of these different sized blocks and on/off algorithms that creates the distinctive patterns seen in every frame of the collection.\nDigital Bath was created with p5.js over different periods from June 2022 to November 2023. Influenced by a song from the band Deftones, I wanted to show what electricity moving through water may look like, but in my usual colorful, minimalist, blocky, abstract way. Each output gives off an energy as new patterns bounce from one frame to the next.\nAll visual elements are simple rectangles, which fall onto a grid of alternating rows and alternating columns. This grid results in four sets of lines, two horizontal sets and two vertical, and each one can be turned on and off from frame to frame. Each of these sets of lines on the grid are divided into segments and assigned an on/off algorithm. Dozens and dozens of on/off algorithms determine which of the rectangular segments should get drawn for a particular frame.\nThe work runs in real time, with each frame determining its segments and algorithms before drawing to the canvas. To give a bit of time for the eye to lock onto each pattern, the default frame rate is just 10 fps. Enough time to catch each frame, but fast enough to give a glitchy flowing feel. However, with the up or down arrows, the artwork can be sped up or slowed down as each viewer sees fit.\nTo use the key controls, make sure the artwork has focus by clicking on it first. Other than just controlling the speed you can also zoom in and out using the &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;O&#8221; keys respectively. Zooming can create completely new feels from the original work or provide it with a border. If you want to focus on each individual frame, slow it all the way down to 1 fps, or even use the spacebar to pause the animation and move through frame by frame using the right arrow key.\nEvery output can easily be turned into an animated gif using the &#8220;G&#8221; key. A save dialog box will appear with default settings, but framerate, length, and resolution can all be changed here. The zoom setting seen in the current work will be used for the file being created.\nAs mentioned, each frame is drawn in real time, with the exact same look every time the work is ran. Let it run for 10000 frames and frame #10000 (the frame number can be seen in the console when pausing the work) will always look the same.\nAs well, the works never repeat themselves. While some frames in a given work may show a similar overall pattern due to the same segments and algorithm (and other factors) being selected, the flow of the art is constantly evolving in its own way as it runs. Due to the frames being drawn in real-time there is never a loop point that is reached where the frames start over in the same order (as you will get when creating a gif that must repeat after so many seconds/frames).\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DigitalBath_59.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/654d17501d92a8ed5de1dc8f

14739,Going Down,"I have created two entirely new songs for this contest. The first is ‚ÄúGoing Down,‚Äù which encapsulates some of the founding philosophies of the cryptocurrency space that I first connected with when I found crypto: self-determination, resilience to crises, antiauthoritarianism and a general distrust of the system. \nThe production was inspired by 90s boom-bap records produced by creatives like The Alchemist, but with a more modern twist and free of samples. The instrumental is dark and synth-heavy, creating an eerie unease atmosphere that allows the sharp piano chords to cut through. This sets the backdrop for the lyrics, which focus on the idea that the system around us is rigged against the common person and will inevitably collapse at some point. For many in the crypto space, this is a core belief and a major reason for supporting decentralized, alternative financial networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n‚ÄúI be on that fuck a bank, keep cash in the cracks of your mattress‚Äù\nCrypto has historically been counterculture, and decentralization is inherently antiauthoritarian. These two factors are what initially captured my attention in 2020. I was someone who never used credit cards because I didn‚Äôt appreciate financial surveillance. I run all my traffic through a VPN, and I spend a lot of time ‚Äî perhaps too much time ‚Äî thinking about whether or not our existing system is sustainable.\nThe artwork for the song captures the feeling of the music and the lyrics, featuring a nighttime, slightly futuristic, slightly aflame city filled with soldiers. Perhaps this is what it will look like if it ever ‚Äúgoes down.‚Äù\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/going-down-limited-4500-scaled.jpg,2560,2560,469507,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/maddopemadic/going-down

14729,Friendship,"&#8221;Friendship&#8221; is a piece I created to show people that A.I can coexist with humans if we stop trying to fear it. It is fairly normal for humanity to fear or feel threatened by things we do not understand. However I feel like the way forward is to embrace these new things and find ways they can enhance our civilization. \nIn the piece you see a girl and a robot painting together. The girl is painting the robot and the robot is noticeably flustered by it. Such cute interactions i&#8217;d love to see in the future. Where we aren&#8217;t afraid to have fun with things we don&#8217;t understand quite yet.\nThis artwork was made by inpainting an A.I image from Leonardo.AI. I often find that A.I creations still has a lot of flaws in them. Often not depicting what I really want it to. So the way I combat this, is to give a simple prompt. &#8221;a girl and a robot standing in front of eachother in the middle of a flower field in front of a japanese village&#8221;. Then after I use my art skills to in paint away the errors the A.I makes and add attributes I need to tell my own story. I paint using an ipad and an apple pencil in a program called &#8221;Procreate&#8221;.\nThis is how I believe we should utilize A.I art in the future. Work together with them and learn how to make beautiful art with them. Because generating an art piece is only the beginning of a creation process. Having fun with A.I and then painting with them is truly the way to utilize A.I art. This is a thought I captured in my piece &#8221;Friendship&#8221;.\nHave fun, embrace new things and learn from them. Do not fear them, as they could be the most crucial art companions on your art journey.\nThankyou!\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pandymonium_Entry_OP_Contest-1.png,2732,2048,5307150,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/ethereum/0x60773C06f329a1EFf928bE3F9b93724E69650e2f

14700,UNSEEN CLUB,"The UNSEEN CLUB was a first-of-its-kind drop blending fashion and music. In an effort to merge the physical world and Web3, angelbaby‚Äôs merch drop/song release pushed boundaries and set a new precedent for artist apparel. \nThe merch is the music. \nThe UNSEEN CLUB is a musical journey encapsulated within a hoodie. It opens up new avenues for artists to combine a music release with physical merch and set a framework that can onboard the next billion users. \nHow it Worked:\nTLDR:\n1. Upon receiving their hoodie, fans scanned their hoodie and instantly claimed their hoodie token on OP. They were officially part of the Unseen Club. \n2. Once fans claimed their hoodie token, they were instantly airdropped the Music NFT of ‚ÄòUNSEEN‚Äô. This was the only way to receive the limited edition Music NFT. \n3. After the drop of the forever edition on Sound, hoodie holders could claim a share of secondary revenue of the song on Tokenbridge. \n4. All of this took place on Optimism. \nEach ‚ÄòUNSEEN CLUB‚Äô hoodie is embedded with a unique IYK chip. There were only 100 limited edition hoodies. The chip allows each hoodie to serve as a gateway to exclusive music and music NFTs. After purchasing and receiving the hoodies, fans were able to tap the IYK chip on the hoodie to receive exclusive benefits. Upon tapping the chip on the hoodie, fans could claim a ‚Äòhoodie ownership token‚Äô on OP, which in turn sent the limited edition version of the ‚Äòunseen‚Äô music NFT straight to their wallet. The only way to receive the limited edition NFT of ‚Äòunseen‚Äô was to claim it through the hoodie. \nThe journey didn‚Äôt end there. Each fan became an integral member of the UNSEEN CLUB, sharing in the success of ‚Äòforever edition‚Äô mints of the song on Sound.XYZ. UNSEEN CLUB hoodie holders can go to Tokenbound and collect their own percentage of the splits on the song. This claim process all takes place on OP. The more mints driven through Sound.XYZ, the more the group of hoodie holders collectively benefit. \nDoing this allowed the UNSEEN CLUB to become an innovative and modern street team on top of a group of fans more connected than ever to their favorite artist. \nOn Jan 19th, hoodie holders will gain exclusive access to a remix of ‚ÄòUNSEEN‚Äô straight through their hoodie. \nThe merch is the music. \nUsing OP In The Future:\nThis project set a new framework in artist merchandise and fan engagement. Because of the physical component it‚Äôs friendly for non-Web3 users. We believe projects that can use physical merch as a gateway to onchain music will help onboard millions of users to Web3. \nLooking ahead, an OP grant allows us to continue to bridge the gap between physical merch and onchain music. We would love to offer new drops using a similar framework and expand the scale of this framework by adding new features based on what we‚Äôve learned. The UNSEEN CLUB was just the beginning.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Unseen-Image-scaled.jpg,2560,1920,864435,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/angelbaby/unseen

14664,Veil Of Deception,"This artwork boldly confronts the issue of disinformation, specifically within the digital sphere, shedding light on its roots, ramifications, and the urgent need for societal overhaul.\nWith vibrant lines, this piece visually captures the swift propagation of falsehoods, embodying the confirmation bias that entrenches individuals in their beliefs. It vividly illustrates the rapid dissemination of lies online, emphasizing the intricacies and uncertainties that blur reality. The artwork portrays the impact of various causes of disinformation: source credibility, confirmation bias, emotional appeal, information overload, algorithmic filters, fear, uncertainty, and the complexity of information. An enigmatic figure at the artwork&#8217;s core, shrouded amidst shifting data patterns, symbolizes obscured truth amid the chaos of misinformation. Vibrant hues evoke emotions, accentuating the seductive yet deceitful nature of disinformation. Fragmented visuals surrounding it mirror the challenge of navigating truth in the digital landscape.\nThe deliberate use of a female figure echoes the Garden of Eden narrative, emphasizing disinformation&#8217;s historical impact on humanity. Eve&#8217;s consumption of misleading information parallels the perpetual suffering caused by disinformation, highlighting its lethal nature. Within my Web3 experience, the artwork reflects on how people fall victim to scams due to inadequate source credibility assessment and verification oversight.\nAs a Web3 educator, witnessing the damaging effects of virality and subsequent verification neglect, I engage daily with the ramifications. Beyond unraveling disinformation&#8217;s impact on trust and communities, this artwork stands as a beacon of hope. It champions critical thinking, verification, and collective action as remedies against this pervasive epidemic.\nCombatting disinformation remains pivotal for nurturing an informed and unified global community. Through meticulous fusion, this artwork resonates profoundly, urging viewers to reevaluate their approach to information consumption and dissemination, igniting a call for transformative societal change.\nREFERENCE: The Adam &amp; Eve Bible Story (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&amp;version=KJV).

Thank you in advance. üôè\nProcess and Tools:\nThis artwork turned out to be more complicated than I initially thought it would be.\nI began my journey into AI art on (https://playgroundai.com) upon a recommendation as a newbie. Experimenting with the website, I understand how prompts function and generated several pieces that I adored. While the results were beautiful, they didn&#8217;t quite match the images in my mind.\nMoving on to Stable Diffusion Web, (http://stablediffusionweb.com) I found better outcomes than on Playground AI,(http://playgroundai.com) yet they still didn&#8217;t fully capture the intended prompts. Later, I discovered PixArt Alpha (https://stablediffusionweb.com/PixArt-alpha)\nby Stable Diffusion, where I achieved more satisfying pictures, though not precisely as envisioned. Persisting with this platform, I created two unique pictures using different prompts that I admired. \nUsing Artbreeder, (http://artbreeder.Com) I blended these two pictures together, resulting in a satisfactory outcome that I settled with.\nFollowing the successful mix on Artbreeder, I utilized Stability AI Sandbox, (https://platform.stability.ai/sandbox/image-to-image)\n to generate the entire collection by adjusting the image strength randomly.\nAs an artist and a newcomer to AI art, the exploration was adventurous, although there were moments of boredom. Throughout this process, I learned immensely and feel motivated to continue delving into AI art.\nThis entire process spanned around 3 weeks of relentless work, resulting in a milestone that I am genuinely proud of. \nI ‚ô•Ô∏è the art\nThank you so much for your time!\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VOD-ori-04-1.jpeg,768,768,87666,1of1s,"OpenSea,Stability AI",https://opensea.io/collection/veil-of-deception

The song &#8220;Love Elevator&#8221; is like that magic ride. It has beats that make you want to dance and words that make you feel all happy and excited, like when you&#8217;re going on an adventure.\nThe picture for the song shows a person dressed like an astronaut (you know, like the ones who go to space) standing on a cloud. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re riding the cloud to go higher and higher because of the power of love, which is pretty cool, right? And there are birds flying all around, which makes it look like it&#8217;s a fun and free place to be.\nSo, &#8220;Love Elevator&#8221; is a song that&#8217;s supposed to make you feel like you&#8217;re on a thrilling ride to all these awesome places that love can take you. And the astronaut on the cloud shows that love can make you feel like you&#8217;re floating way up high, where everything is amazing and nothing can bring you down.

The woman, rendered in shades of blue, embodies a spectrum of emotions‚Äîserenity, introspection, and perhaps a hint of melancholy. The fluidity of the brushstrokes creates a seamless connection between the observer and the solitary female figure, emphasizing the profound unity of the feminine spirit.\nThe composition invites contemplation, encouraging viewers to delve into the emotional landscape within the blue hues.

14635,300 Faces of Ethereal Resonance,"Upon a steady stream of a flat beam of light, a prism emerges as a masterful conductor. While it might be perceived as a barrier, absorber or distraction, it also serves as a guide, channeling the uniform flow into branched paths, yet preserving coherence. As the light reflects and refracts through the prism, each wavefront parts and reunites in a dance that appears chaotic yet harmoniously orchestrated. With the presence of a prism, every angle of incidence becomes an opportunity to unlock a visual symphony within the space.\nSimilarly, ecosystems like Ethereum orchestrate a symphony of decentralized endeavors. This platform directs an immense flow of smart contracts and interactions, branching into myriad projects, each with new capabilities, tailored responses, towards reduced &#8216;absorption&#8217; rates.\nAt the heart of this generative artwork lies an interplay of physics, programming. These are visualizations of complex electromagnetic field, intricately solved in 2D space through MATLAB using the ‚ÄúFinite Difference Frequency-Domain‚Äù technique. In this sequence of 300 simulations, a light beam interacts with the scatterer at various incident angles. The scatterer, comprising six prisms and a lens with refractive indices ranging from 1 to 2, forms a tribute to Ethereum project. Maxwell‚Äôs equations are used to calculate the electromagnetic field at each point, and visualizations are generated to show light intensity and wavefronts, revealing the direction of energy propagation. \n&#8220;300 Faces of Ethereal Resonance&#8221; is more than a series of animations; it&#8217;s a deep dive into the physics that shapes our world.

I learned how to play it on keyboard and arranged the whole thing in Ableton Live. All the melodies you hear are played and composed by myself. \nThis piece was inspired by my feelings of mortality and how quickly life slips you by &#8211; as portrayed in the description below\n&#8220;Where Did the Time Go?&#8221; It&#8217;s not just a title; it&#8217;s a haunting question that reverberates through my being.\nThis piece is a mirror reflecting the relentless march of time. With each panel, I wove a tale of fleeting moments, a silent narrative of love, loss, and the relentless passage of life, accompanied by my own musical score, each note an echo of my anxiety.\nAs I crafted the frames, I revisited those cherished scenes. The tender embrace of love&#8217;s inception, where every glance held an entire universe of affection, harmonised with the melodies I composed. Sounds which resonated with the emotions that transcended words.\nEach frame a testament to the vibrant tapestry of family, a collage of moments that once felt eternal, intertwined with the musical rhythms that echoed the heartbeat of these memories.\nYet, as swiftly as scenes change in life&#8217;s theatre, the narrative took a haunting turn.

A melody of longing and regret.\nMy heart sinks with the weight of regret, questioning every second lost, every unsaid word, every missed opportunity to cherish and express love. &#8220;Where did the time go?&#8221; I ask, the question echoing through the chambers of my soul, harmonising with the bittersweet notes that emanate from my creation.\nThis artwork, this emotional outpouring, serves as a diary of emotions laid bare‚Äîa plea to seize the fleeting moments, to wrap life in an embrace before it slips away.

Several of my male friends were on the losing end of brawls over ridiculous arguments, other guests were trashing the house, and my female friends were being harassed by random groups of men at this event. I was trying to keep the peace as best I could, but eventually, some of these folks tried to fight me, and that was when it dawned on me, it was &#8220;go time&#8221;.

They eventually left, and my friends and I enjoyed the rest of our night peacefully.\nTwo years later, I received this beat from electic Dutch producer Sapjer, and I freestyled about the events of that night to it.

The solitary figure represents a guardian or an observer of sorts, standing amidst a contrasting play of light- the ethereal, hopeful orange rays against the somber, blue-hued environment.\nThe wooden cart laden with lifeless bodies symbolizes the inevitable passage of time, the fragility of life and the culmination of the human existence. The juxtaposition of light and dark signifies the eternal struggle between life and death,while the figure&#8217;s stance reflects a silent contemplation of the consequences of human actions, serving as a poignant reminder of our collective mortality and the consequences of our choices.\nùëá‚Ñéùëí ùëùùëüùëúùëêùëíùë†ùë†:\nI use Blender 3D for the creation of this scene.

14602,"Ok, So Here&#8217;s The Truth","This artwork is an exploration of vulnerability and was painted in acrylic on raw, unprimed canvas using only three colours: black, white, and blue.\nI had never painted on raw canvas before, and it&#8217;s not something that is technically recommended because the nature of the canvas and wood on which it is framed on means that it&#8217;ll be at the mercy of natural elements and would degrade and decay faster.\nI was attracted to this process because it is so human‚Äì all of us are decaying. We can try as hard as we can to curate false images of perfection, but ultimately we cannot fight nature. \nThe story was, what if we embraced our raw, authentic selves? This essence of vulnerability is far from a surrender&#8230; it manifests as a force of strength.\nA lot of us use hair for self-expression and psychologically, for protection. For many, it is also a symbol of strength (see Samson). What happens when all of that is taken away and people see our &#8216;naked&#8217; selves aka the truth?\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20231218_211646.jpg,2293,1939,2597795,1of1s,Manifold,https://app.manifold.xyz/c/heres-the-truth
14600,Spread Joy,"My technique is that of Mixed Media because my artistic process draws on the combination of singular elements. It is a cultural mirror that evokes the great conceptual and visual richness of our time. It is not only a mode of operation which allows me to explore a variety of techniques both in the creation of objects in sculpture, paintings, as well as in the composition of shots and in digital art but which allows me to draw on philosophical or poetic sources as sensitive aggregates.\nIn this work, the poetic basis is Augure of Innocence by William Blake which inspired me to associate the elements. These first verses powerfully connect times and spaces, in the manner of Taoist philosophy. This way of changing scale and perspectives is the basis of my technique. Also, the first of these elements which constitutes the background texture and the subject is one of my photos of my 5 year old son posing against a wall reworked with Affinity photo.\nThe second element is the Nebula NGC 7635 taken by Hubble in the constellation Cassiopeia, known as the bubble nebula. It comes from the NASA photo background under common creative license. This is an absolutely incredible image for its atypical and beautifully colorful nature. This image of space is the opening beyond the frontality of the wall and is related to the symbolic breath of the little boy made of stars and hearts. The last element being the creation of a dynamic particle layer to highlight the cosmic dimension, this animation is produced with Motionloop.\nIts context of creation is closely linked to my reflections on the artistic and psychological gesture of caring for the collective psyche. In my creative process, my plastic research draws from a positive aesthetic corpus which targets one of the functions of art as a process of regenerative transformation of society. My artistic positioning is based on the desire for care by offering the gaze a psychological state which allows me to meditate on its meaning in oneself and in the world.\nThus Spread Joy aims to be a radically militant work, it is a call to fight against apathy, despair and anger. Joy is the primary emotion which will initiate the movement of desire of universalist consciousness. Because there is a need to first rediscover the essential vitalist principles and then project ourselves into desirable futures. Anger and Joy are two antagonistic and powerful emotions that function symmetrically within oneself and in the world, one is a poison, the other is its cure. Images shape our psyche and it is inevitable that the violence of the images of the world which is burning on all continents resonate in us to also feed a form of anger. This is why it is time to refuse the degenerative circle and to oppose a transgressive model, that of Joy. There is a need to reconnect with the child within yourself, that part of pure wonder, buried under a thick layer of protective hardened leather made of guilt, cynicism and indifference. \n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xfebaf563abe5e607ff8c74279fa678ce8dc0b5e8/1

He wore an Iyoba mask, and performed on a horse, like the Benin horse &amp; rider bronzes.\nThat symbolism is incredibly relevant to me because religious africans are quick to demonise the beauty of traditional culture. \nThis piece re-imagines Rema, in an Iyoba mask with a flame burning within the face mask, as the gallant horse rider. He rides a horse adorned in the traditional Edo beads as regalia. The background emulates an abstract sunset, with bats flying around. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ravage-kf-3.png,1570,2792,9322186,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5b3372f1f054dd56670878ff3ff128992f47a826/2

14530,Take Flight (Final Submission),"This song has helped me many times. It is a kind and friendly reminder that I must take flight, because I was built to fly. I must pursue my wildest dreams. I cannot wait until another day, another month, another chance. Every moment is precious ‚Äì life is precious. So, what am I going to do in this blank page? How am I going to fill my days? Do I leave my destiny up to fate or do I take actions in my hand? Will I take flight? Or am I too scared of failing?\nIt is when I hear lyrics like these that I get perspective again. It is when I turn off the noise, and turn on the truth, that I remember who I am. It is thanks to these tracks that I find myself again when ‚Äúlife happens‚Äù and I get messed- and wrapped up in all the mundane.\nJust like a bird doesn‚Äôt fly in a day, and it will fall a few times, I fall, too. I have fallen multiple times. Probably you as well. Yet, by now I am sure that I will get up again. As the song goes: ‚ÄúIf you fall, don‚Äôt let it change your mind‚Äù. My mind is set. Now it‚Äôs time for my actions to align.\nI can say that this is another song that has saved my life. I hope through the recognition this track can get with the We Love The Art competition, it could save other people‚Äôs lives too. Winning any tier of this competition will not only push me closer to realising a bigger impact through my music but also magnify the message of this song to millions of listeners who can use it as a reminder to keep on moving.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-15.09.57-2.png,1538,2050,4967363,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/levisilvanie/take-flight

14512,THE POOL PARTY,"Concept: &#8220;THE POOL PARTY&#8221; transcends the literal depiction of a joyful gathering and delves into the surreal. It explores the subconscious desires and anxieties bubbling beneath the surface of seemingly carefree social interactions. The vibrant colors and playful forms mask a sense of underlying tension, inviting viewers to question the authenticity of happiness and the complexities of human connection.\nProcess: The artwork began with a series of digital sketches exploring the themes of fluidity, connection, and hidden emotions. Through a combination of generative algorithms and manual manipulation, I built a dynamic composition where figures intertwine and morph, blurring the lines between individuality and collective identity. The vibrant palette was chosen to evoke a sense of fleeting euphoria, while subtle distortions and unexpected juxtapositions hint at the darker undercurrents.\nTools Used:\n* Software:¬†Adobe Photoshop,¬†Processing (a creative coding environment)\n* Plugins:¬†Glitch effect plugins,¬†custom-built AI scripts\n* Techniques:¬†Layering and blending textures,¬†generative code for organic shapes,¬†manual digital painting\nAdditional Insights:\n* The distorted reflections in the water symbolize distorted self-perception and the masks we wear in social situations.\n* The absence of faces allows viewers to project their own interpretations and anxieties onto the figures.\n* The looping animation adds a sense of hypnotic uncertainty,¬†as if the party is an endless cycle of emotions.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x71a7fFebeD0e98358ad1d3a05B5fA3D72Ff4D41c

14490,Telepathic Chilldren (Dream Your Dreams),"Welcome to the Telepathic Children.\nThis piece was inspired by a chapter I read in a book called &#8216;Living In The Heart&#8217; by Drunvalo Melchizedek, a book that explains how the heart is another brain and has the ability to connect and receive information, similar to the mind. This is achieved by accessing this system through activating your Merkaba Field, which happens to be the shape of the Toroidal field when a person reaches this &#8216;Heart&#8217; space. This form and frequency transcend all dimensional aspects of nature and physics. Even our Earth magnetic fields produce this shape naturally, also known as Birkeland Currents (CME).\nA chapter in the book touches on the subject of Telepathic Children that have been discovered all around the world in the last 20 or so years. One specific case was over 1,000 children found in Mexico City who were able to &#8216;see&#8217; using the exact same body parts as the kids in China. Blindfolded, an 18-year-old Mexican girl, Inge Bardor, can accurately know everything about the people or place in a photo simply by touching the photo. Inge can also describe the person who took the picture and what the photographer was wearing that day. In one photo of the inside of a house, Inge psychically went into the house, describing exactly what was down a hallway that was not shown in the photo! To test her ability to read with her feet, she stood blindfolded on a newspaper and read it perfectly.\nResearchers found these kids were able to do this by accessing their Heart space, which allowed them to essentially remote view the information without use of their physical eyes. \nAs crazy as this may sound to most of you, it is real. Here is Inge Bardor demonstrating her abilities at the &#8216;Through the Eyes of a Child&#8217; conference in the early 2000s.\n[Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7m1IPjLfk]\nThe quote at the end of the song is an excerpt from Inge Bardor&#8217;s introduction from the video above.\nI hope this song brings you joy and wonder to your heart and inspires you to find a way to work with your mind and heart in unison. \nMost importantly Dream Your Dreams, Goodnight Children. \ntwanz\nSources: \n1st hand accounts of Inges Bardor and psychic abilities:\nhttps://steemit.com/psychic/@eco-alex/the-day-i-met-a-super-psychic-child-with-drunvalo-melchizedek-and-had-my-mind-blown-a-true-story-with-a-movie-as-proof#@stillwatersart/re-eco-alex-the-day-i-met-a-super-psychic-child-with-drunvalo-melchizedek-and-had-my-mind-blown-a-true-story-with-a-movie-as-proof-20170823t115548296z\nP.S.\nWhat you are seeing in the video is true visual form of each of those sounds in binaural.

It&#8217;s been beautiful to see his rise to fame, and the quality of his music getting even better. \n&#8220;Ravage&#8221;, named after his most recent EP is a tribute piece to Rema &amp; Edo culture. He typically uses the bat emoji to represent the bats seen in his home city, Benin. I relate heavily, seeing the bats fly at sunset in my city as well. \nFor his 02 concert, he went full out with expressing his culture with even more symbolism. Representing the stolen art of the Benin people that lay in British museums as he performed. He wore an Iyoba mask, and performed on a horse, like the Benin horse &amp; rider bronzes.\nThat symbolism is incredibly relevant to me because religious africans are quick to demonise the beauty of traditional culture. \nThis piece re-imagines Rema, in an Iyoba mask with a flame burning within the face mask, as the gallant horse rider. He rides a horse adorned in the traditional Edo beads as regalia. The background emulates an abstract sunset, with bats flying around. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ravage-kf.png,1570,2792,9322186,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5b3372f1f054dd56670878ff3ff128992f47a826/2

14431,The Lost Kingdom,"Ever since I can remember, I have been captivated by the world of art. The ability to convey emotions, stories, and ideas through visual expression has always fascinated me. As a child, I would spend hours doodling on any surface I could find, trying to capture the essence of the world around me. As I grew older, my passion for art only intensified, and I began to explore different mediums and styles to express myself.\nMy interest in art goes beyond the simple act of creating. I am captivated by the history of art and the way it has evolved over time, reflecting the changes in society and the human experience. I have spent countless hours studying the works of the great masters, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Vincent van Gogh, trying to understand their techniques and the messages they sought to convey through their art.\nAdditionally, I am drawn to the diverse world of contemporary art, where artists push the boundaries of traditional mediums and explore new ways of expressing their ideas. I find it fascinating how artists like Banksy use street art to make powerful social commentaries, while others like Yayoi Kusama create immersive installations that transport the viewer to another dimension.\nMy interest in art has also led me to engage with the local art community. I frequently visit galleries and museums to appreciate the works of established and emerging artists, and I have even participated in a few group exhibitions, showcasing my own creations. This exposure to the art community has not only enriched my understanding of art but has also allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion.\nMoreover, my love for art has inspired me to explore different cultures and their artistic traditions. Traveling to various countries and experiencing their art firsthand has given me a deeper appreciation of the diversity and beauty of human expression. From the intricate patterns of Islamic art to the bold colors and forms of African tribal art, I am constantly amazed by the richness and variety of artistic styles across the globe.\nIn conclusion, my interest in art is multifaceted and deeply rooted in my desire to understand and engage with the world around me. It is a passion that not only drives my creativity but also enriches my life by connecting me to the history, culture, and people that make up our diverse and beautiful world.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OP-Kingdom.jpeg,2400,2400,2248282,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x373eb7842217b2cb0ed9818a697bd490dc7d7a42/1

14396,Never Ending Story,"This album was created 10 years ago. This work began as a part of my research in the &#8216;digital intuitivism&#8217; spectrum. My thoughts revolved around how technologies can affect our daily lives, how the dimension of reality changed in the perspective of its connection with our everyday experience. Also, how we are connected with some sort of predictions, anticipating behavior that can control the vector of real-life movements. The points in time in a digital dimension that affected both body and soul experience.\nThe artwork was created as &#8216;pixel art&#8217; ‚Äì I used a screenshot of the program called &#8216;Ableton Live.&#8217; I found out that in the dimension of programs, I can use anything as material or palette: as audio material, it can be a sample; in a visual aspect, it can be a pixel, and the color can generate itself entirely. In this way, I can extend this artwork indefinitely, and this piece will never lose its quality.\nFor the bass of the song &#8216;Day After Darkness,&#8217; I used a sample from the Psychic TV song &#8216;The Orchids.&#8217; Of course, sampling isn&#8217;t something new, but this represents an extended aspect for the music experience in the perception of existence. Whenever you incorporate material from someone else, you are extending the experience of the moment when this piece was formed, and even if it&#8217;s just a second element, the power or energy still works in its metasubsonic existence.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/necer.jpg,1400,1400,226919,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/playlist/b3c6d883-c25f-40ca-9469-f929fd6a16ad
14395,JUNIOR JR. &#8211; Never Switch [Bunshin Pass],"When it comes to creating music in this format, we start with one of the most fundamental principles of web3: IP ownership. \nUsing my own IP from RTFKT&#8217;s Clone X collection, I have created a digital rapper known as Junior Jr, who has gone through several iterations and modifications to maximize the IP usage. The current version for this video was given hair and cloth simulation for real-time movement with any motion the character makes, processed by UE5. \nSpeaking specifically for the music, it was designed to embody the actual culture of rap music through my own personal style. The goal is to reach as wide of an audience as possible, and to get the idea of a digital entertainer to resonate with people beyond the web3 audience. And to do this, the lyrics can&#8217;t just contain niche web3 references and shoutouts. \nWhen it comes to the video behind the music, I collaborated with Pending Reality, and we practiced a few new techniques so that we can set up a consistent and cost-effective creation pipeline for the future. All of the character movement was done using Move AI. We were able to capture my own body movement with a beta app for the iPhone, and transfer it over to unreal engine, where we could then use Live Link to link the facial expressions and mouth shapes.\nThe best part about this music NFT is the second layer of collaboration with Pending Reality. Utilizing a video game that he has been building, we were able to add an application for artists in-game, so that fans can link their music NFTs and gain access to a viewable performance of the music in BUNSHIN TERMINAL. This will be available to the public in the near future. \nThe BUNSHIN TERMINAL is a high-end metaverse concept built in UE5 featuring ways to play with digital identity via motion capture, virtual production, and worldbuilding. Supporting community driven experimentation of expression with hardware raytracing support, onchain VRM avatar importing, external 3D assets importing and AI. It will give music NFTs another usage with actual replay value, so that they don&#8217;t just become tokens in a wallet that don&#8217;t actually do anything. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BUNSHIN-JR.png,984,984,1257842,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x4ad40ac8d91d07c52c459e618eeef7da553d8fd7/1

14386,"Autorretrato, 2023","&#8220;I am my own muse. I am the subject I know best. The subject I want to know better.&#8221; &#8211; Frida Kahlo.\nAutorretrato, 2023 (english: Self-Portrait) is an autobiographical digital artwork whcih &#8211; technically &#8211; features a total of 100 artworks across a 5000x5000px canvas. The original Photoshop file consists of over 1000 layers. The creation of this artwork took me 2 1/2 months.\nMain inspiration for creating a new self-portrait was Frida Kahlo, a Mexican painter known for her many self-portraits. \nAs a Mexican myself, I&#8217;ve always found myself inspired by her autobiographical work and her quote &#8211; which started my journey of creating the most time-consuming artwork I have ever made.\nEach square within the artwork features a portrayal of a section of my life, a memory, an experience or a feeling I have felt in my life. I call those squares &#8220;fragments&#8221;.\nMain visual inspiration for this artwork was one of my fav childhood board games called: Snakes &amp; Ladders.\nIn Snakes and Ladders a number of &#8220;ladders&#8221; and &#8220;snakes&#8221; are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The objective of the game is to navigate one&#8217;s game piece from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.\nMy artwork follows a similar system: the fragments are connected with each other like puzzle pieces. Some artworks extend beyond one square &#8211; or continue in another place.\nTogether they build my silhouette (same silhouette seen in my pfp I have been using for 3 years).\nMetaphorically speaking, each fragment shapes who I am. \nI believe that each memory, each experience and each influence we had/have in our lifetime builds the &#8220;us&#8221; and shapes us into the person we are today. Autorretrato, 2023 represents that for me.\nThus I have hidden Easter Eggs and references in my artwork as well, such as \n-Some of my fav movies: 2001: A Space Odyssey\n&#8211; People that influenced me: my fianc√©, my late best friend\n&#8211; Beings that are dear to me: my dog\n&#8211; Art that inspired me: Brion Cemetry\n&#8211; Past Artwork made by me: Phantom Regret\nAnd more! \nI hope you have fun exploring the artwork and perhaps, find new potential references. &lt;3\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Autorretrato-2023-scaled.jpg,2560,2560,724887,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xdca070e3b2bc181a0ab6d849abd15d39ed7ff7c8/1

14353,Change is the Only Constant,"Throughout my life, the only thing I&#8217;ve felt was an absolute constant, was the concept of change.\nAnd it usually happens when I least expect it to. As soon as I get comfortable with a new living situation, daily habit, a general way of living my life, everything does a 180, and I&#8217;m in a totally new situation that I have no choice but to adapt to.\nThis was definitely the case during 2017. I had been in the music scene for a few years up until that point, working for a music blog, writing articles and reviews of new musical releases, playing guitar full time, making content and trying to grow my audience. I was all in on music, no doubt. And then in the summer of that year, right around the time I was graduating from high school, health issues knocked me off the path that, at the time, I was convinced was leading me to a successful career.\nThose health issues consumed so much of my life for almost 2 years. I could barely eat as much as I needed or wanted to, I had to make a lot of lifestyle changes, and ultimately had to grow up real fast in order to learn to deal with this new way of living. It also forced me to come to terms with how burnt out I was becoming when it came to being a full time musician.\nFor a year after that, I didn&#8217;t want to touch my guitar, or even listen to music. After recovering and healing from my health issues, I eventually learned to enjoy it again, but things were much different now. I felt very lost, both creatively and career wise. I fell into a deep depression, and would spend most of my days alone, getting high, hiding in my room, and playing video games.\nAfter awhile I started working in marketing, but still felt so lost, felt like I wasn&#8217;t doing anything meaningful or impactful with my life. This went on for about a year. Then covid happened, and I once again, had a lot of time on my hands. And for awhile, I had wanted to try photography, so I took this free time as an opportunity to start learning how to shoot. And quite honestly, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be in as good of mental and physical health like I am today, if I hadn&#8217;t decided to jump into a new creative pursuit.\nLooking back on my life so far, I&#8217;ve recently realized how many changes I&#8217;ve gone through, even in the last five years. It&#8217;s been A LOT. Just in the last two and a half years alone, I&#8217;ve become a full time artist once again, managed to sell my art and sustain myself by doing so, meet some of the most creative and inspiring people imaginable, and get into a relationship with someone that I now am creating art with. \n&#8220;Change is the Only Constant&#8221; is a photography composite + digital painting piece created with my significant other, after we had a long conversation about this very topic one night in the summer of 2023.\nWe&#8217;ve known each other for over 8 years now, but started dating two years ago. And I can say for certain that she has been one of the most positive changes in my life, without a doubt. I&#8217;ve never felt more inspired to create than I do when we&#8217;re making art together. And this piece is one of our many representations of that.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Only-Constant-is-Change-scaled.jpg,2560,2274,1748796,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x3a64abba68ba90d27325d503b38fcd65a30d6272/2

14321,Epic of the Sovereign Sun,"In crafting &#8220;Epic of the Sovereign Sun,&#8221; I harnessed the capabilities of AI to breathe life into the ancient legends of Persia. This art piece is my digital ode to the intricate beauty of Persian miniatures. At its heart, a warrior king on horseback represents the archetypal hero, surrounded by the chaos of battle, with each soldier&#8217;s armor meticulously detailed. The background is a celebration of Persian architecture, with domed structures and spires that reach towards a mystical sky adorned with stars and moons, symbolizing the cosmic battle between light and darkness. The four corners of the artwork are graced with angelic figures, overseeing the scene with celestial vigilance. This AI-generated artwork, crafted by my own design, is an intricate tapestry that intertwines the human and the divine, the historical and the mythical, all converging in a single moment of epic storytelling.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALL¬∑E_2024_01_02_23_02_21_An_intricately_detailed_artwork_in_the.png,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x28f73d4a4086a1a7aa11b6e79e8b7187400c3540/3

The videos found are all opened in new windows and layered as if tangible material, meant to overwhelm with intense imagery and sound mirroring the sheer volume of information online.\nAs the internet progresses and the capabilities of digital art advance, what will be unique is the record of when the work was created in relation to the digital landscape. In that sense, the screen recording does not shy away from showing browsers and the current iconography of YouTube and internet culture -this is meant to date and wear like a patina would on a physical piece of art.\nThis first work is the starting point of Outlive Death&#8217;s presence and is marked by the shift to post-imagery and post-internet.

Unlike perspective drawing, there is no vanishing point in isometric projection. Furthermore, the 3 coordinate axis have equal foreshortening, eliminating the need to alter lengths based on the perceived distance from the viewer. This allows one to create 3D objects that accurately describe the complete form and all dimensions with efficiency. Traditionally, Isometric projection is used for technical drawings in engineering, architecture, and the assembly guide to Lego set. However, these characteristics also make it a perfect style for game graphics. Marry it with pixel art, and something truly special happens.\nThis artwork created pixel by pixel with Adobe Photoshop.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-Optimism-City-1of1-Art-Contest-Imam-Arifuddin-300dpi.png,6763,5451,1413120,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659c549466d1a3855c932ca3
14240,Why Wait,"This piece is a culmination of 5-6 years of work and experiences.\nI started writing this song in 2018 during one of the worst and best years of my life and finished it in 2019, (lyrically). I recorded the song in 2020, had it mixed and mastered that same year, then filmed and directed the music video in 2021 and edited it for the most part in 2022, adding the finishing touches at the end of 2023 till now.\nIt represents the end of a mind block that I had and the answer to a question that the title imposes, Why Wait?\nCreating and even identifying as an artist, has been a heavy mental battle for me, that&#8217;s been worth every second because of where I&#8217;ve emerged. Stagnation, imposter syndrome and waiting &#8216;for the right moment&#8217; has tried to stop me but I&#8217;ve emerged at the other side and this is what this creation represents. The piece description I wrote in 2022 is the ‚ÄòChapter Title‚Äô and it holds strong till this day as the second half of the creation, (as found in the manifold description).

14232,Public Good Funding (PGF) &#8211; Deep Fields,"A small dark patch of the night sky often reveals only a few stars to the distant eye until, with enough focus and exposure, you uncover a cosmos in the making. This image unravels a similar story in public goods funding in the form of code-created art using data on Gitcoin.\nEach honeycomb bin represents a project that has earned more than $10 in direct donations in 2023 on Gitcoin. Its brightness is proportional to the funding in direct donations from the community.\nWhen the brightness is linear to the amount received, we hardly see more than a couple dozen projects. This is consistent with the power law distribution leading to the most popular public goods getting a lion&#8217;s share of funding.\nHowever, every dark bin still packs the potential to be a &#8220;star&#8221; over time. We simulate &#8220;long exposure&#8221; to capture the light coming from these seemingly darker spots by rendering the honeycomb&#8217;s brightness on a logarithmic scale (versus linear).\nNow, with this renewed perspective, we can see the potential for light in every bin &#8211; a signal to the community that even if their direct donations might not be going to the most popular public goods projects, their ecosystem-wide support is essential for the &#8220;primordial soup&#8221; to create a vibrant cosmos of public goods projects!\nThe code for this art is at https://github.com/rohitmalekar/PGF-s-Deep-Fields\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-09-at-12.15.26-AM.png,1876,1590,3371137,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x4e17da9659cca38ebfd98446d2b404bf94fe9997/1

14227,CORPERATE GUY,"In the dynamic corporate landscape, a diverse array of individuals comes together daily, transcending boundaries of race, age, and location. Whether in bustling metropolises or serene suburbs, men from various backgrounds navigate the intricate labyrinths of their chosen industries.\nUnited by a common ambition, they craft their narratives in the relentless pursuit of success, with each chapter marked by unwavering dedication and resilience. Through boardrooms and cubicles, their shared commitment to progress transforms the corporate world into a vibrant tapestry where meritocracy triumphs over preconceived notions.\nThe collection I&#8217;ve curated serves as a visual narrative depicting the day-to-day activities within the corporate realm. It is an engaging art collection that explores the realm of pixel art.\nIn my creative process, I meticulously craft traits using Aseprite, a tool designed for pixel art. These traits are thoughtfully created to avoid negative interactions that might impact the overall outcome during the generation process.\nThe collection came to life through Hashlips ArtEngine, an open-source code tailored for developers and artists. This tool allows for the creation of multiple unique artworks based on provided layers containing traits. The intermittent Development Environment (IDE) I employed is Visual Studio, running on Node.\nFor those interested, the link to the Hashlips ArtEngine tool and code can be found here: [https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine).\nMy entry was generated from seven distinct layers: background (8 traits), body (8 traits), face (5 traits), hair (14 traits), and outfit (11 traits). In total, 46 traits were meticulously crafted. Using the Hashlips Art generator tool, I established the growth size (collection size) as 98. Each trait was assigned a weight affecting its rarity, and layers were arranged thoughtfully to ensure a proper outcome. The art was then generated, resulting in 98 unique pieces, one of which has been submitted, while the rest can be accessed via OpenSea.\nA quick glance can be taken at my website: [http://corporateguys.xyz/]\n(https://coperateguys.wordpress.com/).\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/74.png,1080,1080,3446,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/corperate-guys-4

I plugged my headphones into the mic spot of my laptop and attached them to the guitar. That worked! Ended up doing everything else in my laptop, using a pretty ordinary audio software.

The world had evolved, leaving behind the remnants of fossil fuels and embracing a new era. However, Africa had chosen a different path, refusing to bow to external pressures. Neocolonialism was the last battle the leaders had to fight which resulted in the continent being ostracised by the international community.\nAbout 400 years passed, and the borders were removed inside the continent, with a collective utopian society residing on the continent with tribes reclaiming their rightful land.

14192,As Marias &#8211; Family Cookbook,"The submitted work is a Family Cookbook that documents the fashion collection &#8220;As Marias&#8221;, launched in December 2023. \n&#8220;As Marias&#8221; pays tribute to women&#8217;s unseen, unpaid, and undervalued labor that, contrastingly, gives birth to some of the most treasured things in life: our sense of home and community, our family units, the smells that encode everlasting memories and the cherished traditions that survive generations. \nThe collection was documented in a family cookbook that now lives on chain as an NFT minted on Zora. The recipes are themselves evidence of the overburden placed on women in our family and crystalize the importance of their contributions to the formation of our family identity. It&#8217;s an acknowledgment of their oppression and a eulogy to the treasures they built in spite of and within it. I hope that, occasionally, the recipes in this book can also teach any reader &#8211; yes, Kens, we believe in you! &#8211; how to cook delicious food! \nIn dialogue with my previous collection, &#8220;As Marias&#8221; continues to explore the women&#8217;s relationship with the body. While &#8220;Meia-lua&#8221; focused on exploring the infancy and pre-adolescence, this collection focuses on the adult women and how its bodily experience is affected by the patriarchal structures that it inhabits.\nThe documented collection uses digital prints and most are built from scans of a selection of cooking magazines from the 80s and 90s from my grandmothers‚Äô collection. These magazines are filled with recipes that teach women how to properly fulfill their assigned gender roles, which the collection intends to challenge. \nThe comfortable silhouettes &#8211; like leggings, unfitted long-sleeves and floaty dresses &#8211; and bold patterns and colors interact in a delicate dance of balance that women master. The intention is to liberate the overworked adult women from the overhead of constraints imposed by fitted and rigid silhouettes, while empowering them to boldly embrace their beauty and femininity. The comfortable silhouettes also recognize and shelter the soreness of the female experience encoded in both worldly things and striking events: ovulating, carrying life and death, nourishing and bearing newborns, growing, collecting and cooking food, and constantly seeking hideout from the male gaze.\nThe title embraces one of the most adopted feminine names of all time to evoque the collective female identity. It is also a reference to five Portuguese Marias that are references themselves: the author of Cozinha Tradicional Portuguesa, Maria de Lourdes Modesto, the author of As Mulheres do meu Pa√≠s, Maria Lamas, and the three authors of Novas Cartas Portuguesas, Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Velho da Costa and Maria Teresa Horta. All responsible for having exposed the female experience in Portugal and codified our excellence.

This song was composed right after a Paul Kalkbrenner concert in Italy. It was a summer and rainy day, but the folks didn&#8217;t care about it and danced through the night. That inspired me so much I had to do my own version from that gig. An electronic music, composed with few tools. An acoustic guitar, my headphones and a laptop. Only those were used. The headphones were plugged into the mic spot of the laptop and I attached them to the guitar and recorded it. The rest was composed using an ordinary audio workstation in my early days of music production. Very intuitive and passionate about this creation. First time going online after twelve years.

The tragedy led me into the club scene, seeking refuge in a world of revelry and self-medication.\n&#8220;Echoing the strings of our past controlling our present actions, the choreography mirrors this intricate dance of life&#8221;.\nCrafting the choreography within the symbolic &#8220;Echo Temple&#8221; in Sweden, a place that intertwines the birthplace of my dance career‚Äîthe Opera House, tied to King Gustav III‚Äîwith its rich history, I merge emotions with movements, bridging the past and present, healing through cherished memories and honouring creative origins.\nTrading traditional pointe shoes for the edgy Buffalo Shoes, I blend the raw energy of the club scene with the elegance of classical dance, birthing a fusion I call ‚ÄúCypher Ballet‚Äù.\nThe culmination of the music video marks my liberation from the chains of the past- a mastery of lessons learned in the club&#8217;s atmosphere and the graceful movements of classical dance. It&#8217;s the metamorphosis into the artist known as Xattan, a tribute to resilience and evolution.\nAcknowledgments:\nA heartfelt thank you to the community and record label whose passion and support were invaluable in producing this music video. Special gratitude to Crypto Musica Records, not just a unique record label but pioneers in the evolving landscape of the music industry&#8217;s Web3.

14182,Deuntje,"&#8220;Deuntje&#8221; means tune or jingle in english. The dutch word deuntje comes of rather funny and innocent, which was the idea I had behind it when I started producing it (dutch is my mother tongue).\nAfter +15 years of doing music production in my bedroom, I came to the sense that things shouldn&#8217;t always mean that much, or hold a specific story behind them. Hence the title &#8220;Deuntje&#8221;. It is just creation, enjoyment and flow of the moment &#8211; with no real plans or goals in mind.\nThe track is completely instrumental and electronic. Even though I play piano, everything is made inside the DAW, and every single note has been clicked with my mouse.\nI used East West&#8217;s composer soundbanks, to give a more cinematic and acoustic feel to the instruments with the cello&#8217;s. Alongside various oriental and african based vocal samples, which I bought from different samplekits.\nSynths that were used are my favourite choices, mainly Diva, Serum and Sylenth1. \nAny other samples, such as percussion, come mostly from different samplekits and went through a lot of processing &#8211; such as compression, EQ, and a bunch of other things.\nAll together it became this experimental, but calm melodic track which eventually flows into more dance music. I took inspiration from the english producer &#8216;Tourist&#8217; here, which I&#8217;m a big fan of. \nI love melodic euphoria in music, combined with oriental textures. Besides these two things, I still have a hidden-love for dance and bass music &#8211; and tried to combine these elements.

14181,GET OFF MY LAWN (MUSTACHE),"In this piece I chose to make a mustache out of grass where I also had my bandmate Dave &#8211; a white man &#8211; be the model using movement. My face is the canvas of this piece.\nThe purpose of this piece is to bring light to black spaces and narratives that are being overly consumed or erased by the white narrative and gaze.\nI think we talk about gentrification in only literal terms like the removal of a people &#8211; and this is true &#8211; but in this piece it‚Äôs deeper than that &#8211; its when home (your body, your voice) isn‚Äôt home anymore. What I can consider home can be anything and I wanted to show my home &#8211; my body &#8211; being occupied by a white narrative that has no place there and the unfortunate inability to do or say anything and just act like it‚Äôs fine &#8211; hence the blue bright sky‚Äôs in the eyes.\nIt‚Äôs understandable for us (the oppressed) to be silent to keep peace, but sometimes you have to be LOUD and fight even if it feels like the efforts are futile. They are not.\nIn addition the song is used to create the tone of regret and illusion. A world where you are told if you follow the rules you will be fine&#8230;a world full of lies you only find out when hit adulthood.\nPs.

I think it has lost all its frightfulness and gives itself fully to the eye of the beholder. For me it is Luzifer. For you maybe something or someone completely different. \nThe whole work was originally painted on a 140x100cm canvas. Painted with oil, acrylic and chalk. I painted over a period of about a month. The painting changed often. It&#8217;s hard to stop at some point and say that the manual part is finished.\nAfter this happened, I digitized the work and worked it out in photoshop.

And then all of a sudden, a marvel human engineering and effort would appear that would dazzle the world. Building crypto feels very much like that, and this artwork captures that essence.\nThis was generated using OpenAI&#8217;s recent advances in image creation. It started with a basic prompt of capturing the Ethereum logo amongst a skyscraper being built.

14118,Innocence Meets Innovation: The Future in Her Hands,"In Innocence Meets Innovation: The Future in Her Hands, a tender moment is captured where youthful curiosity intertwines with the marvels of artificial intelligence. The artwork portrays a young girl, eyes wide with wonder, as she holds a small AI robot‚Äîher expression a mixture of innocence and fascination. This piece is a visual meditation on the future, where the lines between human and machine blur, revealing a world ripe with possibilities.\nThe concept of this artwork arose from the recognition of a new era unfolding before us‚Äîan age where children will grow up with AI not as a distant notion, but as a daily reality. The girl represents the future generation, while the AI, with its glowing blue eyes, is a beacon of the technological advancements that await. This juxtaposition highlights a unique perspective: AI, often depicted as cold and unfeeling, is here rendered with warmth, as a companion and a guide.\nCreativity pulses through the artwork&#8217;s veins, achieved through the intricate pencil strokes that bring to life the girl&#8217;s delicate features and the robot&#8217;s sophisticated design. The decision to employ a cross-stitch pencil sketch technique adds depth and a tactile sensation, inviting the viewer to ponder the textures of both humanity and created intelligence.\nThe conceptual depth of the piece is anchored in the subtle interplay of light and shadow, the softness of the girl&#8217;s demeanor against the sleekness of the robot. It&#8217;s a narrative about growth, learning, and the guardianship we must take in nurturing the relationship between our children and the machines they will inherit.\nAesthetic impact is not an afterthought but the soul of this piece. Every detail, from the soft fall of light across the girl&#8217;s face to the luminescence of the robot&#8217;s eyes, has been meticulously crafted to create a harmonious and impactful visual experience. The artwork was brought to life using DALL-E and prompting for traditional sketching tools, which speaks to the process‚Äîa marriage of the artist&#8217;s hand and the subject&#8217;s digital essence.\nThe choice to maintain the robots&#8217; eyes as the sole element of color amidst the monochrome sketch serves to draw the viewer&#8217;s gaze, symbolizing the life and intelligence within the tiny AI form. This subtle yet powerful use of color highlights the life spark that technology can offer to our most fundamental human experiences‚Äîlearning and growth.\nThis artwork is a statement of originality, not only in its concept but also in its realization. It challenges the viewer to see AI through a lens of empathy and potential, steering the conversation towards a future where technology uplifts and enhances the human experience.\nInnocence Meets Innovation: The Future in Her Hands is a testament to the power of art to encapsulate complex ideas in a single moment, bridging gaps between generations and the worlds they inhabit. It stands as a profound message of hope, a snapshot of a future where humanity and AI exist in a symbiotic dance, each learning and growing from the other.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Innocence-Meets-Innovation-The-Future-in-Her-Hands.png,1024,1024,1096105,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x7c05508569b551c3608900c45d134e71ffc0a460/2

14096,Embrace for the Future A Child&#8217;s Connection with AI,"&#8220;Embrace of the Future&#8221; is a poignant representation of the gentle intersection where human warmth meets the cool precision of artificial intelligence. The artwork, a touching scene of a young girl embracing a life-sized AI robot, speaks volumes about the nurturing relationship we can foster with technology.\nOriginality shines through in the portrayal of the AI robot, not as an inanimate object, but as a recipient of affection‚Äîa role traditionally reserved for living beings. This unique perspective invites the audience to reconsider preconceived notions about the emotional capacity of AI and its role in our lives.\nCreativity flourishes in the depiction of the embrace. This act, universal and powerful, is reimagined in a futuristic context, where the creator has conveyed a deep and comforting bond between a child and her AI companion. The choice to depict the robot as similar in size to the girl amplifies the message that AI, though created by us, grows with us, becoming an integral part of our personal and emotional landscapes.\nThe conceptual depth of the piece is woven into the very fabric of the interaction. The hug‚Äîsimple yet profound‚Äîhints at the underlying meaning of trust and coexistence. It asks the viewer to consider the potential for AI to become an intrinsic, benevolent figure in the tapestry of human relationships.\nAesthetic impact is achieved through the meticulous execution of the pencil sketch, with DALL-E&#8217;s generative capabilities fine-tuned by my iterative prompts. The resulting image is one of remarkable quality, balancing photorealism with the evocative textures only hand-drawn art can provide.\nThis piece was realized through a synthesis of AI and artistic vision. The process began with DALL-E, an AI program, which generated the initial visuals based on prompts reflecting the concept. These prompts were refined iteratively, blending the AI&#8217;s computational creativity with my human guidance to fine-tune the emotion and intimacy captured in the final sketch.\n&#8220;Embrace of the Future&#8221; thus stands as a dual testament: to the potential of AI in art creation, and to the harmonious future we can shape alongside our digital counterparts. It is a celebration of the new and tender dialogues we can share with the technology we create, and a reminder that the future is not just something we enter, but something we can lovingly embrace.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Embrace-for-the-Future-A-Childs-Connection-with-AI.png,1024,1024,1627982,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x7c05508569b551c3608900c45d134e71ffc0a460/1

I posted a short clip on tiktok and a lot of people sent it to their s/o‚Äôs, and posted pet videos to it, which obviously made me so happy, but then also the producer Marky Style who I was in LA doing a project with was like ‚Äú this gives me Queen vibes, we need to finish this song‚Äù so we got to work the next day in the studio. It was awesome putting into a song how much I love the person i‚Äôm with and plan on being with forever. I think it‚Äôs relatable because it‚Äôs how anyone that‚Äôs really in love feels, like, this person is amazing and you have your own language with them, and that feeling is universal.

But I just want to be honest about this painting and tell you everything about it for you to judge. So this NFT is a digital version of my recent painting. That is how it was created &#8211; I took a real white framed canvas (90&#215;60 cm), and put another smaller black canvas (60&#215;40 cm) in the middle of the white one using screws. Then I painted two fried eggs on it using white and yellow acrylic paint. I managed to make voluminous yolks &#8211; I put a lot of paint to make kinda piles of it and formed them using a big ceramic souvenir cigar wrapped in paper. It took a couple of days for it to dry. Then I put the painting on the yellow wall in my basement, made a photograph of it, and cropped it &#8211; so here‚Äôs a digital image. The black canvas represents a frying pan. Yes, it‚Äôs rectangular, which makes it conceptual. Moreover, I put a secret message on the back of the black canvas that is not visible. Maybe someday, when this painting will be sold at some big auction for millions of dollars and many years after some collector will eventually find it, it‚Äôll be cool. Maybe this painting could be considered as a sculpture because it‚Äôs quite 3d:). Yeah, I agree, The digital version may look not very exciting, but it is what it is. Nevertheless, real painting exists and I love it. If I win &#8211; I‚Äôll reveal the secret phrase hidden in it, but who will know if I tell the truth? See how art it is?

14012,Now You Dance For Me,"‚ÄúNow You Dance for Me‚Äù is an anthem for the underdog, a triumphant exclamation of victory, and a ‚ÄúI told you so!‚Äù moment for the lower class in which the once abused and under-appreciated protagonist has finally paid his dues and risen to the top. An old world nod to the age old story of the student becoming the master, rags to riches, or ‚Äústarted from the bottom‚Äù, Wasted Wine‚Äôs version has an old-world sensibility and humorously deranged narrator. \nWhen recording this piece Robert saw the opportunity to blend his love of character creation and voice acting by creating a different character voice for each verse. Written in an atypical structure, the song has 7 short verses, each preceding a singalong chorus driven by a steady groove. To further add to the drama and variation, each verse also has a completely unique instrumentation, using different instruments and sounds sourced by the band including: Synths, scissors, water, shoes, bass, violin, accordion, flutes, glockenspiel, voices, electric guitar, orchestral percussion, drums, harmonium, bouzouki, celesta, and more in a very ambitious recording rich with character.\nLyrics: \nI used to cut your ribbons, I used to draw your bath\nYou used to take the greater part of what we should have halved\nA couple years have passed since then and now what do I see?\nI used to play the drum for you but now you dance for me.

A blank canvas used by many. Tourists, commuters, locals, and day-trip visitors alike have walked its streets, talked to its people, tasted its cuisine ‚Äî all contributing to an enduring sense of timelessness. Yet, the city finds itself in a state of perpetual change, demanding a continuous birth of new communities, shared spaces, and movements to define its identity and the ones that transit it.\nTo convey this idea, we created a song and visualizer; putting together fragments of videos captured by members of our community, offering a glimpse into their unique perspectives. The artwork is inspired by the often-overlooked industrial heritage of Barcelona. Created by reinterpreting Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Pavillion‚Äù; an iconic architectural representation of the city. It was first built to be showcased to the world at the 1929 International Exposition.\nStarting in 2024, Oval is putting together a series of concert and club nights, community events, suppers, and writing camps ‚Äî designed to foster cross-pollination among individuals who have come to the city in search of something more: a spotlight, a sense of belonging. \nWe believe we can build something better, and we want to do it onchain.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bafybeic33dc7nn7xegqkgzheoymxd2yzei4yupq3dfq553bbnbfpja7bm4.jpeg,8000,8000,2122635,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x79e53edb2eb1d5c4b45c170daed6881afd6f43c8/1?referrer=0x84b44ce42f6E939a4385C936765997e5181Fb720

13990,The Moth,"‚ÄúThe Moth‚Äù has always been a symbol of change and growth. Aesthetically, Wasted Wine wrote this song to be a gateway into their unique sonic world frequently starting their shows with it, luring the audience&#8217;s attention and priming their ears for the deeper journeys ahead. Each verse starts by setting a scene, as if in a dream. Sung by Robert, each verse starts: ‚ÄúSo here we are again‚Ä¶‚Äù a declaration that some patterns in life are unavoidable and repeatable. Then as Adam enters you hear ‚ÄúThe Moth!‚Äù reminding us that change always comes, for better or worse. As an intention, the song is an expression of the pain and struggle of relationships changing. Verse one paints a picture of someone you trusted betraying your love while verse two by contrast has you standing up against hypocrisy. Finally, verse three is a triumphant declaration of the freedom felt when you finally break free of these painful dynamics. The chorus speaks to how painful and cold it can be for either party to cut these ties when you‚Äôve felt loyal and committed.\nAs serious as that sounds, the song is fun, lively, and danceable! Recorded using Logic X Pro, we started by recording the band live. Drums, Bass, Bouzouki, Main Vocals, and Violin were all tracked. The violin and vocals were then replaced in post for cleaner takes and much more was added including: Celesta, Accordion, Glockenspiel, Dan Moi, Whistling, and Backup Vocals. Written first on piano, Robert brought the instrumental to his longtime music partner Adam as an instrumental. They quickly recorded a demo and sketched out a few ideas. Then, taking turns using a stream of consciousness approach to lyric writing, they freestyled melody and lyrics while recording. After a few takes, the two reviewed taking the best parts and rewrote them into the whole. Notably, the song&#8217;s lyrics follow no particular rhyme scheme, yet feel correct partly due to the repeated beginnings of the lines. \nLyrics:\nSo here we are again gathering for holiday. So here‚Äôs to your good health my dearest and sweetest most trusted friends.\nThe moth, the moth flew past your head and you upset the table. You looked at me and said ‚Äúaway, away, away, you cheap and dusty thing!‚Äù\nNow something happened here. You never should have moved your mouth. After all we‚Äôve been through you say.\n‚ÄúJust keep it to yourself!‚Äù\nSo here we are again singing hymns in harmony. The Lord forgives our sins, perhaps for you even a second time.\nThe moth, the moth flew in the door and landed on the organ. Under your breath you swore ‚ÄúNo more, no more, no more of this extravagance!‚Äù\nNow something happened here. You never should have moved your mouth. After all we‚Äôve been through you say.\n‚ÄúJust keep it to yourself!‚Äù\nSo here we are again, to celebrate your memory. You were a decent friend, at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôd like to remember you.\nThe moth, the moth it shed its wings and crawled into the casket. The preacher turned to say ‚ÄúToday, today today I tell you, you have been redeemed!‚Äù \nNow something happened here. You never should have moved your mouth.

13977,The Hill Suite,"The Hill Suite is an example of individual art pieces coming together organically and the amazing journey of art presenting itself to you at different stages of your life, yet becoming part of the same story. Things that seem isolated are all connected when you allow yourself to read the signs. \nHaving released various instrumental records in the soundtrack &amp; library genre I wanted to explore something different and began working with some ambient music composers. Where these musicians were using synthesizers and modular rigs to create, I wanted to see if I could emote the same space and subtle emotional journeys using my bass, guitar, and effects. These experiments would create the bookend pieces of the suite. \nAn avid music nerd, I also was reading a recent Paul McCartney lyric book where he told the stories behind some of his famous songs. In reference to the Beatles songs &#8220;All My Loving &#8221; and &#8220;P.S. I Love You&#8221; he identified them as letter songs. He wrote them as part of a tradition of letter songs, like Fats Waller&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter&#8221; or Pat Boone&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ll Be Home&#8221;. He wanted to carry on that songwriting lineage. So I thought, how can I carry on a new lineage of songs inspired by Paul McCartney? I love the song &#8220;Fool On a Hill&#8221;, so I figured I&#8217;d write a hill song, and I started with the lyric &#8220;Stuck on a hill&#8230;&#8221; This quickly led to the imagery of a person at the top of a hill, stuck, for whatever reason, reflecting and needing to make a choice. It wasn&#8217;t written anecdotally at the time, but it became one of those pieces that subconsciously came to represent another crossroads in my life of deciding to change unhealthy patterns and reinvest in myself. We all have times of feeling stuck and where repeating the same habits are getting you nowhere. That&#8217;s when a change is needed. This would become the second movement of Hill Suite. \nAlthough written at different times and with different intentions, these pieces seemed connected. The first movement contains a repeated bass chord figure with textures moving in and out around it, illustrating melodic and dissonant highs and lows while still feeling stuck on the same loop. That brings us to second moment, &#8220;Stuck on a Hill&#8221;. The song itself slowly grows in production as the narrator reflects and makes a decision to start living and &#8220;roll on down&#8221;. The third movement becomes an etherial space that to me almost soundtracks an empty hill that might have a new person slowly walking up to sit and reflect on if they are stuck and need to roll down. But someone else can now write their song to continue the Hill song lineage. \nThe artwork also came at a completely different stage in my life. In 2011 I was invited to play in Torino, Italy. One morning I went for a walk in a park on a hill overlooking the city. A man was playing his acoustic guitar by himself, crouched down by an old stone wall. I quickly snapped a photo. I always loved this photo, and I knew that I would need it for something. Twelve years later as I finished The Hill Suite I knew exactly what art suited it best. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hill.jpg,600,600,82808,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/base:0xfc45cea4db6f555f3d04796070ed8ec32c158ec4/2?referrer=0x21844640138A348474064180C93AD82f50c89357

13945,Outcast,"&#8211; Inspired by the true story of a beautiful little girl named ‚ÄúAwin‚Äù &#8211;\nI am a teacher living in a small town in Kurdistan. A year ago, when I entered the classroom for the first time and looked at students, I saw a different face. A little girl whose face was completely burnt was sitting alone on a bench. Away from other students. Her name was Awin. She had lost her father in a fire incident and she herself had burns on her face. They arrived in our small town from a village, perhaps her mother can find a job and they can cover their living costs. Days passed and I saw Awin sitting alone in a corner in the school yard and watching other students playing together. There was intense sadness on her face and a lot of desire in her eyes. But I thought she was not in the mood to play. When I asked the reason, her answer made me cry. She said with a heavy grudge in her throat: ‚ÄúMy friends are afraid of me and don&#8217;t want to play with me.‚Äù From that day on, a lot of sadness settled inside me. I don&#8217;t know if the other students had a right to be afraid of her or not. I tried many times but couldn&#8217;t convince the students to overcome their fear of her. Awin and I lived with immense sorrow, until a day Awin was absent from class. I thought she was sick, but one week passed and she did not come to school. I went to their house to find out the reason for his absence from school. A small and very humble house! Her mother said that she did not want to study anymore. My insistence did not help to satisfy Awin and her mother. A few months later, Awin and his mother left our town and I never saw them again. That innocent little girl was rejected from society.\nIn this beautiful but sad piece, the red flower symbolizes Awin&#8217;s burnt face. I chose red because it is the color of fire that changed Awin‚Äôs life forever. The students with faces different from Awin&#8217;s are represented by the white flowers. The flowerpot is a symbol of society, and the scissors are a symbol of society&#8217;s behavior that caused Awin to be separated from education.\nFor generating this artwork, I used Stable Diffusion XL model running on Playground.ai (canvas mode). Upscaling and modifying the image was done using RunwayML and inpainting feature. The satisfactory version of the photo was obtained after 500 generation.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/T1.jpg,1080,1080,354597,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5f5bfcdd8db82949f0abddc797c1b86fc632a61b/1

13940,27th December 2017,"In many of my works I attempt to capture a specific emotion which can sometimes be difficult to describe accurately through words. 27th December 2017 was a particularly interesting time for me, post-christmas, pre-new years, that limbo time where you become contemplative looking back on the year that&#8217;s passed and the year to come. I had just met someone who I would spend 5 years with and started a new job, but had also recently been evicted from my apartment and said goodbye to my grandfather for the last time. Much of these conflicting hopeful, but nostalgic, but sanguine, but mournful feelings I tried to capture in this piece.\nThe cover art is a photo of the Tr√° an D√≥il√≠n (Coral Strand) in the west of Ireland which has some rather unique &#8220;sand&#8221; and crystal clear waters, somewhere I visited often growing up.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_6E5F62561C63-1.jpeg,1122,1120,666136,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x1119ddfdc61cdcf0614053a2d0e2b7b195cff9b3/1
13938,All My Relations,"With this song, I call in the profound wisdom of the Lakota people and their concept of Mit√°kuye Oy√°s‚Äôi≈ã. This phrase translates to ‚ÄòAll my relations‚Äô. It speaks to the deep interconnectedness of all life. From the bees to the kites to the panthers, every being plays a vital role in Earth‚Äôs great tapestry. This song is a tribute to the unifying idea that every creature, big and small, shapes our existence. As you listen, I invite you to reflect on the beauty and responsibility of being a part of this intricate web. Let‚Äôs honor the Indigenous wisdom that teaches us to see beyond ourselves, to respect and cherish every being as inseparable from ourselves.\nI wrote this tune 10 years ago while studying liberation theory and realizing for the first time how desperately I needed the hope and the alternative way of being alive that this critical lens provided me. I feel as if nothing and everything has changed. I feel as if there has never been and will never be a more important truth than that we are all related, all in some way responsible for one another, all longing for the same simple things: safety, clean water, healthy food, freedom to move, love and connection.\nI captured the song in my childhood home in Lake Worth, Florida ‚Äì a place that deeply influences my art ‚Äìwith my lifelong recording engineer and stepfather, Rich Switzer. The recording process was an intimate journey back to my roots, echoing the essence of the song&#8217;s message that we are all a product of our environment, and we are inextricably linked to it. \nThe artwork was created in tandem with the DALL-E image generator.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/All-My-Relations-cover-art.png,1400,1400,3458559,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/lindseymills/all-my-relations

13908,Compassion Across Borders: Israel and Palestine&#8217;s Shared Dreams,"In the midst of a chaotic battlefield, two soldiers, one from Israel and the other from Palestine, find themselves in an unexpected moment of truce. The weight of the ongoing war is visible in the lines on their faces as they engage in a conversation that goes beyond the boundaries of their nations.\nThe Israeli soldier, speaking solemnly, justifies their actions by claiming it is necessary for peace and justice in the world. The Palestinian warrior responds by expressing doubt that revealing the reasons behind their conflict would change anything. Despite this, he invites the Israeli soldier to imagine sharing the intricacies of their motivations, emphasizing their shared objective of creating peace and justice.\nThe conversation unfolds, revealing the deep pain both sides have experienced. The Israeli soldier argues that what they&#8217;re doing to the Palestinian soldier&#8217;s country is justified, mirroring the suffering inflicted on their own people. The video questions the fairness of allowing only one side to advocate for peace and justice, emphasizing the common goal shared by both soldiers.\nThe video challenges the cycle of vengeance, asserting that labeling revenge as justice only perpetuates a vicious cycle of hatred. It delves into the characters&#8217; awareness of the historical patterns of conflict and the inability of humans trapped in a world ruled by hatred to truly understand each other.\nAmidst the bleak realization of the world&#8217;s pain, suffering, and futility, the video introduces the idea of a potential for unity. It suggests that those who appear as opposites can find success through working together. The characters are portrayed as ordinary individuals driven by a desire for justice, but the video highlights the equivocal nature of knowledge and awareness.\nUltimately, the video calls for empathy, compassion, and a willingness to break the chains of enmity. It asserts that the ongoing conflicts, including the one between Israel and Palestine, are not immutable destinies but consequences of choices made by individuals, governments, and societies.\nI created the video from scratch, I used Leonardo.ai for the image generation and runwayml for the image to video conversion.

Tall skyscrapers, like threads of modern weaving, are permeated with greenery and living trees, creating a unique and harmonious combination of architectural excellence and natural beauty. On the roofs of buildings there are real forest oases, where trees and plants coexist with technological innovations. This is not just a city, it is a place where the human and the artificial merge with nature, creating a unique symbiosis. Here, concrete jungles are transformed into oases of greenery, and modern technologies serve not to the detriment, but to the benefit of nature. In the distance, against the backdrop of this green city, lies a huge planet, surrounded almost entirely by forests. This is a metaphor for the unity of humanity with nature. Green tree covers on city rooftops connect with endless forests on the horizon, reminding us of the importance of preserving the nature of our planet. The picture becomes the mantra of Solarpunk, reminding us that in the future, our well-being and prosperity are closely linked to respecting the environment and creating cities where man and nature can exist in perfect symbiosis.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01-6.jpg,515,644,154972,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x2884999a65bb20b154e4a7c8d18337e3e306ad1c/premint-1

The force is calculated in the applyForse (forse) section of blackhole.js. You can change the particle movement pattern by changing the initial speed, acceleration, maximum value, etc. (All key lines are signed in the code). You can also change the number of particles (in the video in the application there are 6000, in the code &#8211; 2500). This is a realistic model, and in the sketch you can add a new black hole, which will also attract particles.\nYou can remove the // before the variables that define the second black hole and see the result. The basics of OOP, vectors, etc. were used.\nConcept\nIt is my second entry for this competition. The initial idea is to simply implement the function of a black hole, but in the process I experiment with the initial speed of the particle, its acceleration, and the mass of the particle &#8211; I got a field effect. I change the values of the particle mass, the mass of the black hole, the initial speed and acceleration of the particle, the maximum speed value, etc., you can get completely different patterns, you can also adjust purely particles. This model implements the dependence of the force of attraction on mass (the law of universal gravitation). The force with which the particle is attracted is calculated using this formula (I was able to obtain the field effect only if the mass of the black hole = 1)\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/contextt.jpg,1038,1156,681761,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xd158e542739b728f8a18330a473ff0e169ad5d12/premint-2

He perceives the object of his love as something that he hates, because such feelings are difficult to understand at first. Perhaps this song will help to confess true love to adults who did not find the courage to do it in childhood. Or maybe this song will help reveal feelings to a child going through love for the first time. It‚Äôs never too late to tell what you truly feel to the one you truly love.\nThe author&#8217;s latest release was recorded in the suburbs of Paris, in the city of Nemours, in the summer, in a home studio.

Everything was done by earring practice in a highly influential environment. This guy told me many people can stay in places up to 5 star hotels, but &#8220;here, you have this billion star hotel&#8221;. I loved that phrase.\nThe process and concept behind &#8220;Abroad&#8221; is pretty much related to the way I was living during a backpacking experience I had when I was a young curious soul getting to know the social and cultural aspects from place to place. Abroad and other songs came alongside the lack of resources and the idea of doing with what you have. An old acoustic guitar, headphones and a laptop were the tools I used to compose and record it. I plugged my headphones into the mic spot of my laptop and attached them to the guitar. That worked! Ended up doing everything else in my laptop, using a pretty ordinary audio software. This is the first time I uploaded this material in Web 3. The contrast of lack of resources and infinite possibilities the web3 can bring, such as an art contest is what makes art genuine.

So thanks for the inspiration on this!\nFor the composition, I wrote a simple but effective chord progression that really grew on me after tweaking it a bit. Then once the foundation was built thanks to the pads, I wrote a melody and a few variations for it. \nIt starts with a pluck I made on Serum, which gives the main notes for the melody that will be heard during the whole song. After 4 bars, I added a synth harp with the same notes to overlay with and give some more weight to these notes. \nThere&#8217;s also some keys I added, with another synth I made on Serum, which I also modified with panning and filters to give that &#8220;glitchy&#8221; effect you can hear on them. It&#8217;s also overlayed with yet another synth, this one is a lead from Spire. \nThe bass is a simple reese bass I made on Serum too, but then there&#8217;s a bass drop! And that&#8217;s where the track gets really interesting in my opinion. So I made a typical hyperpop bass sound, that hits really hard (and was also very annoying to mix&#8230;) and put some very bright synths on the edge of the stereo so that they complete each other well. I was really proud of the final result on this one.\nI also made another lead, that&#8217;s way softer and sounds almost like a flute, and put a very subtle arp too to give some variation during the second part of the song.\nI probably shouldn&#8217;t be detailing everything like that but I feel like it makes it easier to describe how I created the song, I can share visuals of the project or whatever if you want some more information too.\nWhat was left was structuring everything, add risers, and various SFX, tweak my voice samples so that they would fit the song, and then mix everything. And voila.\nI&#8217;ll list the main software/vst I used too so that you get a clear idea:\nBitwig Studio (daw), a lot of bitwig built-in plugins (they&#8217;re really good!), Serum, Spire, Roland Zenology, Fabfilter vsts (for compressor, EQ and limiter, mostly), Crystalline for reverbs, Auto-Tune Pro, SOOTHE2, Manipulator for voice effects, and a bunch of others. \nHopefully this gives you a good idea of my creative process. Thank you for reading this and enjoy the track.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/angell.png,700,700,934651,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659c2a2e41fad46b6bc0e222

This first piece depicts an Ape in a contemplative state with a fungus before it, which dissolves into a scattering of particles, symbolizing the transience of nature and the primal connection between species. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the.stoned.apes_.1of3.wanva_.eth_.png,1024,1024,670169,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x2f44fbf2c88a4e124215f0a58705d2eae12b68e0/1

13651,Dreamscape Hallucination,"Blues &amp; Dance met, then Dreamscape Hallucination was born. It is an auditory journey that fuses the soulful depth of Blues with the pulsating energy of Dance music, an aural embodiment of the contrasting human conditions: the introspection of solitude and the vibrant thrall of communal celebration. The cover, with its vivid urban chaos and solitary figure, visually encapsulates the essence of the music‚Äîa lone soul navigating the exhilaration of a city that dances to the rhythm of both isolation and connection.\nAs the creator of this piece, my intention was to transport the listener to the cusp of two worlds‚Äîthe reflective and the ecstatic. The music is an ode to the duality of existence, the quiet moments of self-reflection set against the backdrop of life&#8217;s unrelenting pace. It is a composition that seeks to express the sweet ache of loneliness, the rush of joy, and the surreal calm that follows the storm of emotions.\nCrafted in Logic Pro X, this song is a meticulous blend of Logic&#8217;s native plugins and instruments with the nuanced finesse of Fabfilter and WAVES. The mixing and mastering processes were approached with a delicate touch, prioritizing the preservation of the song&#8217;s dynamic range and the integrity of the song over sheer volume.\nThis is a narrative set to music. It invites listeners to embrace the chaos, to find their peace amidst the disarray, and to acknowledge that the apparent inner tranquility might just be an illusion. This song is a testament to the modern digital soundscape&#8217;s ability to echo the timeless cries and joys of the human heart.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dreamscape-Hallucination.png,1024,1024,2011413,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x8ab5a9cdd5d2e2cb27c1448a576f0cf5a239d82a/1

13647,As The Phoenix Rises,"As The Phoenix Rises (ATPR) uses real-time data to represent the rise of Ether&#8217;s Phoenix through a generative &amp; dynamic NFT. Every single day, the NFT updates using the overall contribution by chains in the Superchain (Optimism, Base, Zora, Etc&#8230;) to the OP Collective, measured in ETH. As this number grows closer to 42,000 ETH / year, the Spheres become more and more in sync, and the red outline of the Phoenix becomes more visible. \nThe Spheres represent the individual players in the OP Collective. The OP Collective is an experiment in human incentives and coordination. At the start of this real-world journey, the spheres are chaotic. They are moving at different speeds and different orbits. As the daily Collective Contribution rises, these spheres become more and more coordinated and the orbits move towards the same speed and path.\nThe red ring represents the Phoenix. At this start, it is not even visible in the NFT, but as we have a larger and larger daily contribution to the collective, the dream of Ether&#8217;s Phoenix becomes more real, and so does its representation in the NFT.\nOnce the OP Collective is generating more than 42,000 ETH / year, the spheres are perfectly aligned around the Phoenix, which has reached its final form. \nTechnical Overview:\nThe NFT uses HTML + the p5.js javascript library for the rendering and is 100% code-generated. The main data &#8220;input&#8221; is the annualized ETH contribution to the OP Collective. The rendering uses that data input (source below) to dynamical adjust the orbits of the spheres and the visibility of the ring. The input is updated daily using the dune API and AWS. We are also using AWS to host the NFT (for now) after trying many other methods but running into issues updating with the daily number.\nCode: https://github.com/Michael-Vander-Meiden/ATPR\nData Source: https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/As_The_Phoenix_Rises.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x662966c073294c2aa3e1935f2dd09abefd64ee67/1

13618,Epistemology in AI,"The most typical use of AI is for humans to give instructions to AI with the intention of obtaining output. This is a composition in which AI outputs based on the input of human intention, and AI is regarded as a human servant. In other words, AI is used as a tool according to human intention.\nIn this work, we attempted to express AI&#8217;s own subjectivity and interpretation, rather than viewing AI as a human agent.\nThe procedure was to have AI input a visual image randomly drawn by a human, and then ask AI, &#8220;Could you paint this picture?&#8221; The result is this picture painted by AI. This painting, in which AI was asked to input, express, and interpret information that eliminated human intention as much as possible, shows AI&#8217;s own individuality, sensitivity, and imagination.\nWhen asked &#8220;How do you see this picture concretely?&#8221;, the AI responded &#8220;a fluid, ribbon-like form&#8221;.

13599,Catharsis,"Catharsis in E minor, is a profound musical journey through the transformative experience of motherhood, depicted in the crescendo of life itself. It musically narrates the saga of a mother and the life she brings forth, spanning from sunrise to sunset, all captured in a concise time-lapse of a few minutes.\nInitially conceived as a composition for four hands, Catharsis was a dialogue between two entities, reflecting the duality inherent in creation. However, due to the constraints of the contest, it was reimagined for solo piano. This adaptation required not just technical alterations but an emotional distillation, capturing the essence of maternal love and sacrifice in a single thread of melody.\nThe piece unfolds like the day it musically represents‚Äîfrom the gentle awakening of dawn to the fiery passion of noon and the serene acceptance of dusk. Each note, each phrase, is a step in the journey of the mother, mirroring the arc of nurturing and the bittersweet release as her child enters the world and the future unfurls.\nThe accompanying artwork, with its fluid amalgamation of warm and cool hues, embodies the essence of creation, where a mother figure is central, encapsulating the moment of birth. This is not merely a dance but the most primal and profound act of human life‚Äîgiving birth.\nAs the creator of Catharsis, I beckon the audience to immerse themselves in a story that transcends the musical score. This piece pays tribute to the profound endurance, unconditional affection, and intricate sentiments that characterize the essence of motherhood. Encased within a brief musical interlude lies a narrative of enduring life&#8217;s perpetual renewal.\nP.S: It also worths to mention that this piece is performed with a grand piano.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Catharsis.png,2048,2048,4996461,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x97fc970a664afb19f6c1e48def51098a999c36eb/1

13597,Governance On The Rise,"Description:\nEmbark on a visual journey through the evolution of Optimism Superchain&#8217;s governance with this submission to the We Love the Art contest. Witness the rise and significance of the OP token in the Top 100 protocols of the crypto universe, beautifully depicted through a data-driven artistic creation.\n&#8212;\nAbout the idea:\nObserving the fantastic submissions of other artists, many of whom work with random (animated) generative art, inspired me. While I may not excel in that particular style, my proficiency lies in handling statistical software &#8211; R in my case. I was determined to process data from L2 or L3 protocols of the Superchain. Contemplating elegant representations of transactions, different chains, and more, I began sketching out initial programming and ideas. Though intriguing, it wasn&#8217;t the masterpiece I envisioned.\nEventually, a tweet by kain.eth regarding the behavior of various tokens in the Top 100 over the years and their changes sparked a crucial idea ‚Äì a representation of the OP token in the crypto world. Governance forms the backbone of the Superchain and is arguably its most crucial element post-development. I wanted to visually depict its importance, presence, and ascent in the crypto universe, from the first recording of top crypto protocols to the end of 2023.\nThe resulting graphic aims to blend art and data, employing simple colors, shades of gray, with occasional color highlights, some sort of streetart-style. It&#8217;s my attempt to create graphics that captivate both aesthetically and informatively.\n&#8212;\nImplementation:\nThe graphic was programmed in the statistical software R, utilizing historical data of the Top 100 protocols every Sunday from April 28, 2013, to December 31, 2023. It weekly displays the Top 100, where color intensity signifies the duration in the Top 100 ‚Äì the stronger the color (gray or red), the longer the protocol remains in the Top 100. For clarity, the color is most intense when a protocol has been in the Top 100 for a year, equivalent to 52 weeks.\nThe accompanying code is available on my GitHub repository (https://github.com/NoSeals/OP_WLTA/).\nIn addition to all other protocols displayed on the gradient from light gray to dark gray, the OP token is highlighted in it¬¥s typical red. On August 7, 2022, the token first entered the Top 100, briefly disappeared, only to resurface in the third week of 2023 and consistently ascend.

13594,opulence Op,"In a world where the moon shone brighter than the sun, there was a city of gold, built from the insatiable greed of a powerful being. This being, with the body of stone and eyes that gleamed with an unnatural light, had an unyielding desire for wealth and power. The city was his creation and his curse; every building, every street was made of gold &#8211; but it was never enough. One day, as he gazed upon his golden empire, he realized that despite owning everything, he felt an emptiness inside him. He owned the world yet had nothing; he was surrounded by wealth yet utterly alone. The skulls at his feet were a stark reminder of those who had tried to warn him or stop him but were crushed under his relentless pursuit. In this moment of revelation, amidst all his wealth and grandeur against the backdrop of a moon that bore silent witness to his insatiable greed &#8211; he understood that true wealth wasn‚Äôt in possessions but in connections; not in taking but in giving; not in gold but in love and compassion.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_20240108_211052_433.jpg,1024,1024,171333,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x83d0aefbb00481f3218ced3ed1c2df8a1a408fc1/1

Constatar como la inteligencia artificial distorsiona la anatom√≠a humana me llevo a enlazarlo con las antiguas concepciones de la histeria como √∫tero migratorio, lo que abre la dimensi√≥n imaginaria y simb√≥lica del cuerpo, algo as√≠ como un cuerpo ps√≠quico. Me pregunt√© que √≥rganos serian primordiales en la constituci√≥n de mi propio cuerpo, concibiendo estos √≥rganos como un armado de im√°genes y s√≠mbolos. Descubr√≠ que en la constituci√≥n de mi cuerpo son importantes los focos pulsionales, como los ojos y su funci√≥n de mirar y ser visto, los o√≠dos y el aparato fonatorio, por su funci√≥n de escucha, voz, lenguaje, lengua, palabra e invocaci√≥n, el coraz√≥n como la inteligencia sentiente, etc. Descubr√≠ que en esa constituci√≥n imaginaria del cuerpo eran importantes ciertos animales como los animales de consumo humano, que interrogan nuestra crueldad, pero que tambi√©n nos hermanan como vidas reducidas a su funci√≥n de objeto de consumo. Algunos otros encarnan potencias y deseos, como las aves silvestres y reptiles. Ecosistemas como el oceano, la selva h√∫meda, el bosque, representan la renovaci√≥n de la vida y la muerte.\nEsta anatom√≠a imaginaria es una anatom√≠a que no acaba en el limite poroso de la piel y la identificaci√≥n con un yo separado del mundo que observa la vida desde una externalidad, es una anatom√≠a en que, por diversas operaciones simb√≥licas, mi cuerpo es un cuerpo formado por todo lo vivo, tomado por todo lo vivo y es en esa bastedad de la vida que puedo reunirme.\nEstas obras son un trabajo en proceso, que quiero convertir en un libro.

Technological elements fit into the forest landscape like plants of the future, demonstrating how modern innovation can coexist harmoniously with nature. The green wall of the forest peeks through the letter &#8220;O&#8221;, creating the impression that the modern world is merging with the green palette of nature. The modern world is becoming an organic part of nature, emphasizing the interconnection and symbiosis of the two worlds.

13505,Jimmy Whoo &amp; Lea &#8211; Shining,"Conceptually, &#8220;Shining&#8221; is an artistic collaboration that emerged from our shared vision as artists. Rooted in the Motel Music universe crafted by us, the song explores the dreamlike and ethereal realms of love and sadness. Our aim was to immerse the listener in an otherworldly experience, reminiscent of a motel chamber lost at the edge of a desertic road.\nThe collaborative process between us, Jimmy Whoo and Lea, played a pivotal role in bringing &#8220;Shinning&#8221; to life. The songwriting and production unfolded in a Parisian studio, where we both contributed our unique perspectives and skills. Lea&#8217;s vocals became the emotional conduit for the lyrics, while Jimmy Whoo&#8217;s expertise in crafting cinematic soundscapes ensured a seamless fusion of musical elements.\nTo maintain the desired warm mood that aligns with the Motel Music aesthetic, we utilized synthesizers such as Juno and Moog. These analog synths added depth and richness to the sound, creating languorous cinematic compositions that resonate with the overarching themes of love and sadness.\nThe choice of specific instruments, such as Juno and Moog, was a deliberate decision to infuse the music with a distinctive texture. This texture enhances the emotional impact of the piece, aligning with the velour sound and dystopian ambiance characteristic of the Motel Music trilogy.\nIn &#8220;Shinning,&#8221; the thematic parallel with decentralization is subtly woven into the narrative. While not explicitly stated, this element adds depth to the song, encouraging listeners to explore the decentralized nature of emotions and relationships.\nThroughout the creative process, keyboards and analog synths were our tools of choice. The Juno and Moog synthesizers, in particular, played a crucial role in shaping the unique soundscapes that define Jimmy Whoo&#8217;s Motel Music. The analog nature of these instruments contributed to the warmth and richness of the music, enhancing the overall emotional resonance of &#8220;Shining.&#8221;\nIn summary, &#8220;Shining&#8221; is a product of our thoughtful collaboration, where the choice of tools and the incorporation of thematic elements contribute to the creation of a compelling artwork. This song aligns with the Motel Music universe, offering a nuanced exploration of love, sadness, and decentralization.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capture-decran-2024-01-08-a-18.27.03.png,1704,3024,4714779,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0xb965f50a20ec84ff56f86907a5ed1958145fcd43/1/

13497,This is a Microphone,"‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù is art, music, and instrument all in one. This NFT includes 4 sampler instruments: pitcher, slicer, looper, and sequencer.\n‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù is a decentralized instrument designed to use your computer‚Äôs microphone: sing, clap, meow, record samples IRL or audio on your computer to create music. \nMyFi Studio recorded four preset samples for this 1/1 musical instrument, and saved them to each sampler. Click a column to select a sampler, and begin playing back the preset samples. You can record your own samples by pressing the circle in the center. Three dice play a game when you‚Äôre playing music, and stop when you stop playing music. The preset samples include kalimba, drum beat, a Moog Matriarch patch, and ‚Äúthis is not a microphone‚Äù voice. We used these four samplers to record a performance for Optimism We &lt;3 the Art. \nHere is a link to our performance using the four samplers:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWgP_lybKwc. \nThis piece is generated by code and programmed in p5.js and p5.sound. We categorize ‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù as Music and not Generative Art because our focus is music and making electronic musical instruments as art. This 1/1 Music NFT uses code to generate visuals and audio, and it requires the human body to create and listen to the music. We‚Äôre building new ways to create, save, and share music on-chain. Anyone with this instrument can make their own music and record their own samples.\nCan we expand the meaning of Music NFTs?\nMusic reflects the time it&#039;s made in. Music changes based on its venue. Blockchain is the venue now. We make music and tools for the venue of the blockchain with the unique properties of the blockchain. ‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù broadens the Music NFT landscape and its current expectations. Almost all Music NFTs are links to mp3 files stored on a rented server, which doesn‚Äôt utilize the mechanics of the blockchain. We‚Äôre presenting an on-chain instrument that allows people to use the actual blockchain to produce music, rather than just using the blockchain to sell a link to a file on a rented server. MyFi Studio debuted at #4 on Billboard&#039;s Biggest Music NFTs chart in February 2023 for our two collections of on-chain musical instruments: wind tunnels + circles are bad. \nHow to play ‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúThis is a Microphone‚Äù is an electronic music instrument best played on a laptop computer in the chrome browser. \nFirst click on a rectangle to choose an instrument. From left to right, the instruments are: pitcher, slicer, looper, and sequencer. \nOnce you select an instrument, either click the circles to play back samples, or move the slider to adjust how the sample is played back. \nIf you click the circle in the center, you can record a new sample using your computer‚Äôs microphone. \nWhen you click on the instrument, it loads a preset sample that we recorded for you. \nPress the spacebar to pause audio playback.\nPress ‚ÄúR‚Äù to reset a sample. \nInstrument + Samples produced by MyFi Studio\nwww.myfi.studio\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thumbnail_this_is_a_microphone.png,5884,11843,3431002,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659b8d4f41fad46b6bc0e1d3

Many individuals within the Mexican-American diaspora maintain strong ties to their Mexican heritage, creating transnational identities. From an early age, individuals often find themselves straddling multiple worlds. The cultural richness of their ancestral homeland is preserved at home, through traditions, language, and family values. \nWhile individuals may feel a deep connection to their ancestral roots, the reality of living in a different cultural context can lead to a constant search for acceptance and identity. \nChallenges such as prejudice, discrimination, and the occasional feeling of being caught between two worlds is a complex aspect of growing up in any diaspora. These challenges contribute to the resilience and adaptability of individuals, fostering a sense of strength.\nThe Mexican-American diaspora is a dynamic and evolving journey. It is a narrative that weaves together the threads of heritage and the present, creating a mosaic of identity that is as diverse and vibrant as the diaspora itself.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CARA-DE-NOPAL-JPEG-scaled.jpg,2560,1920,872422,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xae9b8e4c6abd812b8caaf069e5bc3a142a7a34a2/premint-1

Zaino and other songs came alongside the lack of resources and the idea of doing with what you have. An old acoustic guitar, headphones, a laptop, a cybershot camera and a kaleidoscope covered with a world map print were the tools to create it. I plugged my headphones into the mic spot of my laptop and attached them to the guitar. That worked! Ended up doing everything else in my laptop, using a pretty ordinary audio software, which later on, It was combined with the video clip. For that, I attached the kaleidoscope I found to the lens of my digital camera and played around while I was listening to the track, now using my headphones properly. This is the first time I uploaded this material in Web 3. The contrast of lack of resources and infinite possibilities the web3 can bring, such as an art contest is what makes art genuine.

This capsule is the result of several months of hard work and research on Van Gogh&#8217;s paintings, entirely inspired by his artistic masterpieces. What makes Van Gogh&#8217;s works truly special is that he used art as a form of therapy and to uplift his own feelings. In fact, it served as a kind of healing process for him. Playing with colors, finding their connections, transforming two-dimensional paintings into three-dimensional designs using real-life images of those scenes and paintings, and putting all these elements together required some serious mental effort.

As the vision danced through my mind, I often found myself yearning to bring this tranquil world to life. It was a place where the sunlight filtered through the canopy, creating a mesmerizing play of light and shadows upon the forest floor.\nOne fateful day, I decided to breathe life into this long-cherished dream. With unwavering determination, I embarked on a remarkable journey, where every stroke of my pen became a testament to the vivid imagery that had once existed solely within the recesses of my imagination.\nThe task at hand was monumental, demanding a relentless commitment of 150 hours of daily work. Each stroke of the pen became a labor of love, each detail a testament to the dedication and perseverance embedded within my heart.\nAs hours melded into days and days into weeks, the dreamy forest began to emerge from the depths of my mind onto paper. The towering trees rose, their branches reaching for the sun, and the underbrush teemed with life.\nMy endeavor was not simply about creating an artistic piece, but about capturing the essence of a cherished dream‚Äîa pursuit that required the utmost dedication and creativity, as well as an unwavering commitment to breathe life into every leaf and ray of light.\nThrough this journey, I learned that the power of imagination, when coupled with grit and determination, can transform the intangible into the tangible‚Äîa forest that once only existed in my dreams now stood before me, a living testament to the resilience of the human spirit.\nThe dreamy forest, now inked onto the pages before me, was more than a visual representation‚Äîit was a reflection of the endless potential found within each of us, a reminder that with perseverance and a relentless passion, dreams can be brought to life.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo1704733243.jpeg,1280,853,502042,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xf398b82e585d744ff4c7011a7a2c2d10a6eff127/premint-1

13390,Adventurous Joyride,"This artwork is fully generated by Dall-E and is inspired by a famous life quote by Hunter Thompson:\n&#8220;Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming: Wow! What a Ride!&#8221;\nIt represents the quintessence of a life lived with exuberance and audacity. As its creator, I&#8217;ve poured into this artwork the philosophy that life&#8217;s essence is captured not in serene preservation but in the spirited embrace of every moment.\nThe elder depicted at the zenith of joy, arms wide and smile wider, is the embodiment of a life without reservations. He rides not towards the end, but from crest to crest of undulating experience. The skateboard, a symbol of youthful daring, underlines that adventure knows no age. Behind him, the graveyard, a traditional symbol of finality and silence, transforms into a launchpad, propelling him into the vivid tapestry of life&#8217;s twilight.\nThis piece is a visual echo of the quote inspiring it ‚Äì a belief that we should arrive at life&#8217;s final curtain call not in quiet decay but with a soul enlivened by the journey. The vibrant colors and dynamic composition illustrate the chaotic beauty of a life thoroughly lived. Skulls, not as omens of mortality, but as accolades of the past, scatter behind him, while the horizon ahead burns with the promise of the ultimate sunset.\nHere each stroke is to challenge the onlooker to reconsider their own ride. It is an invitation to the audience to re-think their paths ‚Äì is it one of cautious reservation or one where every twist, turn, and descent is savored? This art is not just a portrayal; it&#8217;s a call to live a story so full that when the end comes, we can all exclaim with earnest breath, &#8220;Wow!

13383,Readyweight Œ∏,"A new way to share an AI assisted artwork, and allow others to create freely with the concepts underlying it. \nOn the surface this NFT involves a 3d model of an original sculpture we made, a mutant horse that appears in a larger sculpted relief we were commissioned to create by OpenAI in 2022.\nIf you unarchive the 3d model, it contains within it files to allow for anyone to reproduce its form through AI models:\n&#8211; Embeddings (concepts) compatible with various Stable Diffusion models\n&#8211; A LoRA for use with Stable Diffusion XL\n&#8211; Training Data so that one might train their own models\n&#8211; a 3D model of the work\nThese files are also available at the following link:\nhttps://mega.nz/folder/ThRQAYKD#zy9hBW5EeMCt3xHXXx51UA\nWhy?\nIn our 2022 Essay &#8220;Infinite Images and the latent camera&#8221; we discussed the idea of infinity related to media in this new context. Central to our argument is that any artwork now, whether unintentionally or intentionally, can serve as the seed for infinite new works in the AI era. \nFrom our perspective this new dimension of artworks, currently referred to as &#8220;training data&#8221;, is something to lean into and produce deliberately. Once artists learned that distributed 2D photographs of their art were viewed more times than the 3D original, some began to modulate their works to photograph better, implicitly understanding that media recorded of the work was, for better or worse, a part of the work. \nIt follows that artists now might take interest in altering their practices to consciously offer training data of original works they create, or surface and claim these concepts in latent space (more on that later). We feel that in the coming years it will feel increasingly familiar to see artists minting concepts in this way. \nThe title &#8220;Readyweight Œ∏&#8221; refers to theta, a symbol associated with the weights of an AI model, and a cheeky nod to CC0, the license attached to all files related to this work.\nSo what is a Readyweight? \nWe have done a lot of work with embeddings over the years. For simplicities sake, embeddings are numerical representations of concepts (people, things) that exist within AI models. \nFor our collection Classified (Foundation, 2021) we attempted to produce portraiture of the embedding &#8220;Holly Herndon&#8221; within OpenAI&#8217;s CLIP model. Self portraiture of what the model understood Holly to be. \nIn order to explore this concept rigorously, we enlisted the help of Jordan Meyer and Patrick Hoepner. Jordan devised a technique that at the time he referred to as &#8220;Beacons&#8221; that would allow for us to train an embedding in order to hone in on what the model understood Holly to be. This was conceptually interesting, as rather than adding additional data to the model, this was more to be understood as an adventure to dig deeper into the model, an excavation of sorts. \nThat technique was later popularized by a paper released the following year &#8220;An Image is Worth One Word: Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation using Textual Inversion&#8221; by Rinon Gal et al. \nWhat is conceptually interesting about Beacons/Textual Inversion is the idea that any original artwork made today may have already existed within the embedding space of an AI model. \nIt is worth sitting with that thought for a second as it is rather cool. If I create an original sculpture, or painting, today, and train an embedding to look for that work within the latent space of a previously existing AI model, there is a strong chance it can be located as having already existed somewhere in the near infinite combination of vectors inside these models. \nThis raises some interesting questions. We view this observation as less of a weapon to bring to existing debates over AI and copyright, and more testimony to how peculiar and fascinating this new technological substrate is for our conceptions of creativity and originality.\nA new piece that we have created can perhaps be identified as having previously existed in the latent potential of an AI model. It just takes us, as artists, to excavate the model to find it, and share it, so that others might use that concept to make more works like it.\nThis process of an artist locating something that already exists, and coining it an artwork, reminded us of the history of the readymade. So we choose to describe these embeddings as readyweights (weights referring to the vectors that define concepts inside a model). \nThis new sculpture already existed inside embedding space, so we decided to surface and share those weights as an artwork. It is fitting to use the NFT medium to do so. We are minting a concept, and people are free to do what they like with the media connected to it üôÇ\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/readyweight.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x1698e9789d7cb10c90408963f473d59fc303ccb7/1

The lyrics delve into the frustration of navigating through a system where materialism and external judgments often overshadow personal growth and authenticity. Lonely Band contemplates the struggle against gatekeepers, those who wield influence and hinder individual potential. The song captures a journey toward self-discovery and resilience amidst external pressures.\nProcess:\nThe creative process behind &#8220;Gatekeepers&#8221; involved a deep introspective exploration, echoed in the lyrical journey. Lonely Band grapples with the challenges of days without financial abundance and societal expectations. The realization of being more than material possessions and societal judgments leads to a resolve against gatekeepers who seek to diminish one&#8217;s potential.\nThe lyrics portray a personal desert, an inner landscape where the artist confronts their own mortality and vulnerability. The decision to close one&#8217;s eyes and detach from societal pressures symbolizes a deliberate choice to focus on self-discovery and purity of purpose. The clock ticking serves as a reminder of time passing, prompting a profound understanding of self-worth beyond external validations. \nLonely Band employs a range of musical tools to convey the emotional depth of &#8220;Gatekeepers.&#8221; The composition draws from a mix of instrumentation, blending electronic and organic elements. The use of rhythm, melody, and carefully crafted lyrics creates a sonic landscape that mirrors the emotional narrative. \nLonely Band&#8217;s pursuit of artistic purity and resilience against external influences in &#8220;Gatekeepers&#8221; draws a parallel with the principles of Web 3.0. The artist metaphorically builds a creative cloud, a space untainted by gatekeepers, where honesty and love thrive. This mirrors the decentralized vision of Web 3.0, where communities are empowered, and individuals have greater control over their narratives.\nIn a world dominated by centralized gatekeepers, both in the music industry and the broader society, Lonely Band&#8217;s defiance aligns with the ethos of Web 3.0. The emphasis on community, authenticity, and individual empowerment resonates with the vision of a decentralized web where artists can navigate freely, untethered from external pressures.\n&#8220;Gatekeepers&#8221; is not just a song; it&#8217;s a testament to the artist&#8217;s commitment to maintaining purity and authenticity in the face of societal challenges, drawing a parallel with the evolving landscape of decentralized communities in Web 3.0.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Story_Gabarit.jpg,1920,1080,491082,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x178a946e47f9cc78d845c70dbca753820da5cb75/1/

As a species, we possess an extraordinary capability to embrace profound bliss and affection, yet concurrently, we harbor an innate proclivity for acute anguish and desolation. Drawing inspiration from my own personal encounters with these emotions, I seek to capture the raw and often unsettling essence of grief, the depths of despair, and the paralyzing grip of anxiety.\nThis piece employs visual metaphor as a conduit to unravel the complexities of the human psyche, I strive to delve into the depths of these complex and universal emotional states, to create a space for contemplation and catharsis, where viewers can confront and engage with these profound aspects of the human experience.\nThe piece is carefully composed to evoke an emotional response, with the hope to provide solace, provoke thought, and ultimately shed light on the shared humanity that unites us in our experiences of emotional turmoil.\nThe piece was created with a Nikon Z5, and has been processed using Adobe lightroom mobile and Snapseed.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RIFUMB-scaled.jpg,1718,2560,276033,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xdc6703719246cc5afda148472e80f07bcbeae0a9/1?referrer=0x851CE305Da05cF29ef840F7cdc78DcFD87868AfF
13312,OP Concordia Day,"In a magical land, a tranquil lake glistened under the warm sun, where Orthosie, goddess of the earth, sensed a sorrowful presence from the sea kingdom. Compelled by empathy, she ventured onto the lake and encountered Parthenope, sovereign of the deep blue sea, swimming among rocks symbolizing her domain. Despite their differing realms, an immediate bond formed, kindling the promise of mutual understanding and joy between the earth and the sea. The goddesses‚Äô connection transcended physical boundaries as Parthenope‚Äôs enchanting song reached Orthosie across the waves, expressing fascination with this unexpected presence. A warm smile spread across Orthosie‚Äôs face as she felt the assurance that her mission of empathy and goodwill had commenced. The prospect of a newfound kinship between the earth and the sea sparked a glimmer of hope, illuminating their vast domains with the promise of mutual understanding and joy. This heartwarming encounter between Orthosie and Parthenope heralded a harmonious alliance that would bridge their respective domains, bringing solace and companionship to both goddesses. Every year, this monumental meeting between Orthosie and Parthenope brought joy to the world, celebrated on ‚ÄúOP Concordia Day‚Äù.\nProcess:\nI tried to make a story out of Optimism word. the first idea was to create queen of nature in the form of deer horn and beautiful waman that people live on her horn with animals toghather and ect. but in the process of sketching it didnt result good . I didnt find a good story in that so this time started to think that this queen must do sth with her power or she has kinda duty in her life also I didnt liked the waman face it didn&#8217;t feel like a Godess and was reapeted. In short, it got to the point where I saw that it would be better if the queen was not the center of the story, so I thought of a second character and this is where the idea of meeting two gods came to my mind. The name of the first god starts with the letter o and the second god starts with the letter p.also the history of them is related to Optimism concept. In order to show the difference between the two Gods and their world, I decided to divide the world into sea and land. During the design and development of it, the continuation of the story was gradually made. The meeting of these two gods will bring blessing and happiness on earth, which is a reminder of the meaning of the word and people will celebrate this meeting years after it. it can also be the sign of changing the season too:)) . The most difficult part for me was showing the letters O and P imperceptibly. To be part of the story and not have an advertisng effect. but I could do that with putting the into nature elements like rock ot cloths elements for earth Godess. whole process was in Photoshop. I got my references from pinterest by searching: Queen, god of nature and ect.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OP-Concordia-Day_small.jpg,2200,1800,4078869,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x19BC1365ebBAa8c676CAA42085F478FE2798179b

The wind, string, and voice sounds are made with a Mellotron. Everything is recorded and mixed in an earthship in the middle of the Carson NF, very far away from any semblance of civilization.

13295,Dyasp0r1c0,"In the work &#8220;Dyasp0r1c0&#8221;, which is part of a collection on indigenous Brazilian and African diasporas, I bring together elements that represent the diaspora to which I belong, the quilombola, trying to encompass different elements because of the different contexts, times and locations in which they arose, but which are in dialogue because they are part of the same diaspora.\nIn my self-directed photographs, I use elements such as transparent, blue and green fabrics to represent the enchanted people of the rivers and the Parna√≠ba River, which bathes my family&#8217;s quilombola community in the state of Piau√≠ and which for generations has served as food, survival, sustenance and healing for the various families and peoples who live around it. The enchanted are entities of nature that protect it and the beings that live in it.\nIn the photographs, I cover myself with one of these cloths representing the incorporation of these enchanted people into my body and the continuity of life that the river gave to my ancestors.\nI also adorn myself with a beaded tiara and juliet glasses because the act of protecting oneself, adorning and enhancing one&#8217;s body with accessories, handicrafts and clothing is also a culture in my diaspora: it&#8217;s how you express yourself to the world with elements that represent your inner self and your identity. \nIn the tiara I wanted to bring height and as materials I used beads and conches representing the entities and ancestors who take care of the head, the paths and the wisdom. In the glasses I wanted to make reference to Brazilian funk, which is a diasporic expression of my generation and I grew up having contact with it.\nBrazilian funk emerged in the peripheries just like samba and other expressions that were and are criminalized and marginalized for having indigenous and African origins. It is possible to find in funk a lot of similarity with ancestral drum music and funk is not just a musical style but a great culture and in this culture the act of adorning oneself to go to the bailes funk is present and I use the glasses making reference to these adornments.\nFinally, the word &#8220;diasp√≥rico&#8221; is a reference to pixo (street lettering graffiti/tag), which I see very similarly to indigenous graphics, since graphics are a set of symbols that represent a history, a worldview and a manifestation of a time, and so is pixo.\nI chose this work because, as well as representing me, it represents the imaginary of my collective and with the prize I would like to invest in electronic equipment and raw materials that I could use to improve my techniques and circulate this equipment in my community so that we could have collective development, prosperity and financial return.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dyasp0r1c0.png,1350,1080,2704925,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x4a5a15267e485bacccd94db47ae20fca65997b93/1

This blossomed a recording tour on pianos across four continents, yielding a 30-track sonic kaleidoscope: solo, duo, and trio performances threaded through found-sound stories also curated from around the world.\n2 out of the 3-LP trilogy have been released, garnering features on national public radio, JAZZIZ Magazine, and an album-of-the-year accolade by Song Surfing.

Road trips in thunderstorms, especially: the feeling of safety inside the car.\nIt‚Äôs not yet time to tell what happened in #1, but the traumas that resurfaced ended up changing my life.\nI saw how my present-day insecurities sprouted from childhood experiences. Abuse, neglect, and survival tactics that I developed in response. The causes? Probably combinations of violence and ignorance, but also circumstance ‚Äî nonetheless, intuition says there‚Äôs no point in blame, and the only person who can address them is me.\nWith love.\nWhich means I confront my fears, head-on üíûü¶Ñ\nI began seeing a therapist for the first time ever.

This story, told through sound design and a specific relationship to rain, reflects how I feel on day 8 of 2024 ‚Äî\n‚Äî the poignance of peace after tumult, surrounded by love, energized.

And only a few years later, AI had learned all about the world. In the year 2095, humans and AI designed a suit of armor to travel the universe and explore other stars. The armor is designed to be used in all weather conditions, divided into land, water, and air exploration suits, and there is a special suit called &#8220;God&#8221; which is a special treasure search suit. This set is one of them. And after completing their exploration, they will take the information and things they have found back to the human world for further study and development.\nUntil one day a star filled with gold was discovered. So a special operations team was sent to this planet. The &#8220;God&#8221; armor set began an exploration and search operation.\nColor tones: primary colors blue-gold, secondary colors white-black.\nWhat I think stands out and is different from other works created by ai.\nThe sword and horn are quite unique because both the horn and the sword glow. If you look carefully at both the armor and helmet, I tried to add neon lights to make them look different. It&#8217;s almost a neon project. Because almost every part will always have light at some point. And what is indispensable is making the background a different color to the characters.\nCharacter design and various elements\nStart by drawing the picture that you want to be the prototype and inserting the prompt that you want. Then generate images in the Dream app by selecting the images that we like the most. Then correct it so that the left and right sides are equal. Adjust the color and match the armor as much as possible to make it as harmonious as possible. The hardest thing is choosing the pieces you like. and the most complete to use\nIf we get the piece we want, we have to check if our work is similar to someone else&#8217;s by using image search on Google and Pinterest. If any picture is similar or close to someone else&#8217;s picture, we will delete it immediately without regret. wasted time\nDesign + methods to generate + tools\nHelmet &#8211; I tried to make the helmet a white-gold color and tried to add a splash of blue so it wouldn&#8217;t be too white and blend in with the sea. Try to make the left and right sides equal. Adjust the color and match the armor as much as possible to make it as harmonious as possible (Dream)\nEyes &#8211; Draw the picture you want as a model. and glowing gold color, then used to generate until we get the design we like best (Dream)\nHorn &#8211; Must not cover the sword at the back too much. This horn therefore has a bent shape and points towards the sky. (Dream).\nArmor &#8211; Use Nijijourney to craft, choosing for compatibility with helmets. and try to adjust the left and right equally.\nSword &#8211; This is my favorite part of the collection. If you look carefully, the sword has a white character in the middle of the sword and glows (Dream).\nBackground &#8211; The initial idea was to make the entire image gold. But I really like the color blue so I wanted to add it to this piece as well. The place is therefore under the sea (using Nijijourney).\nDetails: Eyes, Helmet, Horns, Sword, Armor\nVarious elements\nBecause the underwater world of this planet is made up of gold. Both buildings and all living things are gold. Both species showed normal fish. and ferocious fish It&#8217;s ready to bite you if you get too close. (Use Nijijourney)\nBecause of trying to adjust the left and right to be equal all the time. So this picture can be flipped and the picture still looks normal.\nThe last step is to collect the details and import the playground to allow the AI to increase the size of the image. and helps add color and make the image seamless from editing\nThis picture is more than PFP.\nOriginally this project was just a profile picture that was developed from (Ether Armor : Optimism) only. But now that&#8217;s not the case. Therefore, I have divided the image proportions and composition to suit each device used and arranged the composition to accommodate the various image sizes.

13275,Color Gift Card,"The first step of inspiration led to the incorporation of the HSL colour model (Thank HashLips Academy. https://www.youtube.com/@HashLipsAcademy).\nThe second stage is to choose an SVG on https://www.svgviewer.dev.\nThe choice fell on the SVG from Andrian Valeanu, a skilled web designer.\n(https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI)).\nDynamic hues of the HSL colour model became the soul of the NFT, with the &#8220;Area,&#8221; &#8220;Card,&#8221; and &#8220;Circle&#8221; each adopting a unique shade. The top left corner, echoing the &#8220;Card,&#8221; adds a twist with different saturation and lightness values.\nAll these components, breathing with life, bring to existence on the blockchain‚Äîan NFT with visual appeal and a story woven into its very fabric.\nAs the image took shape, the third stage came, which required the help of Chart GPT (https://chat.openai.com/). The logic and capabilities of the Smart contract were refined, ensuring a seamless and secure integration of the artistic vision into the blockchain. The dynamic hues, the randomness, and the intricate details were carefully woven into the Solidity code using Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/).\nThe Color Gift Card isn&#8217;t just an NFT; it&#8217;s an experience. The Smart contract birthed uniqueness by injecting randomness through &#8216;block.prevrandao.&#8217; This internal magic ensured that each NFT held a piece of unpredictability, bypassing external dependencies.\nToken details were meticulously crafted. Each NFT boasts a three-digit number, HSL code, token ID, and the dynamic wallet number of its owner. This wallet number narrated the unique journey of the card, updating dynamically with every transfer or sale‚Äîa digital tale unfolding on the blockchain.\nA limited edition of 999 unique NFTs will be minted, each a masterpiece in its own right. But the story doesn&#8217;t end there. The Color Gift Card will hold bonus surprises, teasing recipients with enhanced NFT experiences.\nAnd so, the Color Gift Card, a convergence of art and technology, found its home in the web3 ecosystem, specifically on the Polygon network (https://polygonscan.com/). It stood a testament to the limitless possibilities when creativity and blockchain intertwined.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CGC13.png,1800,2160,1670910,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/color-gift-card

13264,NEO-Yaokai Chronicles,"&#8220;NEO-Yaokai Chronicles&#8221; manifests the ancient Chinese narrative where humans coexist with a pantheon of unseen deities and demons‚Äîa realm where the light of humanity meets the obscurities of the supernatural. This art piece delves into the origins of these mystical beings, which arise from the unfathomable and dissolve into the vast sea of imagination. It embodies the millennia-old human endeavor to comprehend the incomprehensible: the mythical creatures that reside within the fragmented subconscious of our collective psyche. Through this work, the line between the tangible and the otherworldly blurs, inviting viewers to explore a universe where divine apparitions and phantasmal beasts are as real as the ground beneath their feet, conjured from the darkness by the most powerful sorcery we possess‚Äîour own imagination.\nIn &#8220;NEO-Yaokai Chronicles&#8221;, the creative process mimics the metamorphosis within traditional tales where individuals transform into entities beyond mortal understanding. The artwork captures the AI&#8217;s anthropomorphic rendition of gods and monsters, a process reminiscent of humans piecing together known fragments within the mind to form new, extraordinary visions. This volatile alchemy of AI artistry, where data becomes distorted into a wild, monstrous dance, reflects our current societal masquerade. Masks worn by individuals render true identities elusive, and beneath these guises, one might find a human, a ghost, or a creature of lore. By harnessing AI to simulate the modern consciousness, this piece seeks to reimagine the contemporary human mythos of monsters, akin to drafting a modern &#8220;Classic of Mountains and Seas,&#8221; and, in doing so, carves out a new chapter in the annals of supernatural folklore.\nIn crafting this piece, I ventured into a symbiotic relationship with AI, melding historical art forms with modern algorithms. I drew upon a rich tapestry of traditional Thangka imagery, meticulously selected from Himalayan Art resources, and infused these with the digital essence of a Stable Diffusion base model. My bespoke &#8220;Tangka&#8221; model‚Äîtrained with this fusion of past and present, spirituality and pixels‚Äîbecame a conduit for creation. Through this process, the AI and I, in a dance of co-creation, unleashed a series of divine and demonic forms onto the digital canvas, each shrine a testament to the transformative journey of art and artificial intelligence.\nIn &#8220;NEO-Yaokai Chronicles,&#8221; one witnesses a contemporary resurrection of the Tanka tradition, interwoven with the disruptive aesthetics of digital expressionism. This artwork stands at the crossroads of the Thangka&#8217;s spiritual didacticism and the chaotic neural networks of AI, reminiscent of the unpredictable nature of Surrealism yet grounded in the meticulous craft of traditional Tibetan scroll paintings. The use of keywords like &#8220;hell,&#8221; &#8220;skulls,&#8221; and &#8220;neon lamps&#8221; invokes a juxtaposition akin to Juxtapoz Magazine&#8217;s celebration of underground comix and the punk movement, while the piece itself, as a crypto-art, nods to the Dadaists&#8217; embrace of non-traditional media and their challenge to the established art market. The artwork thus becomes a beacon of modern myth-making, a digital shapeshifter that redefines the narrative of monsters and deities for the 21st-century audience.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xcb6172a6767b1edfdae687df92cc433a92ce36ce/1

O and P&#8217;s letters was challenging for me because I didn&#8217;t want it to be too obvious and also to be clear. In the smaller circle in which I put the bird, which is inspired by Japanese drawings, I tried to point out the form of the letter O and also show the letter O by separating a part of the letter P at the same time. This work was done with Photoshop and my references were taken from Hokusai&#8217;s wave painting and Disney style characters. Also, the motifs on the letter P are traditional Turkish motifs.

13181,Volatile Geometry,"Volatile Geometry by Paul Seidler is an onchain collection of 57 NFTs that are computed and rendered on the Optimism blockchain. The NFT image is generated by the EVM at runtime from stored bytes that are the result of an agent-based process. The pattern is created from the iterative application of a 2-state towerite algorithm, which is calculated by the smart contract. The contract itself has stored both the image data (initially a black background) and the token-specific turmite algorithm. Each token is assigned a different byte based turmite algorithm, which determines the final appearance. In the rendering process (i.e. when tokenUri of the smart contract is called), stored bytes are rendered via position-specific interference patterns and output as a bitmap. The smart contract really functions as an image-generating medium.\n Volatile Geometry is a non-conceptual work of art in which all immutable interactions within the work are formalised by the program code. If blockchain as a technology implies the rejection of transcendence (in the sense of trusted third parties), then Volatile Geometry is an attempt at immanent software art: No Gods, No Masters, No Servers, no trusted third party, no URLs. The code functions as a formalised operationalisable concept. The semantics of the programm code provides a direct vector for utilisation by the compiler itself. The concept of the artwork only becomes relevant through the proof of successful operationalisation. \n As both the calculation and the rendering process of Volatile Geometry take place onchain, Optimism is essential for the work as an infrastructure. Despite optimisations, the calculations consume large amounts of gas, which makes the project appear uneconomical on a layer 1. The project thus also points to a possible future: Trustless Generative Art\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/VG.png,1998,1998,64376,1of1s,OpenSea,

13172,Mount Annie," ‚ÄúMount Annie‚Äù, a video art piece. It features painting, music &amp; dance, all elements of my lifelong artistic journey. I used craft paper, acrylic paint, my body, a guitalele, a ceiling fan and an iPhone. Working with limited resources, I created this piece start to finish, minted &amp; submitted all from my phone. I‚Äôm proud of that! It‚Äôs a win for the financially disabled everywhere. Especially with the low fees using OP. \nMy art being a vehicle for self reflection &amp; personal growth, the process always involves creating first, then coming to an understanding of what my subconscious is expressing. My process is free flowing. I start by picking out colors and allow the art to emerge through my body as I go along. I fully immerse myself into the creation, then i reflect on the completed piece, what emotions &amp; memories it stirred in me, what colors I choose, what shapes emerged. For me the art is the process not the destination. So I try to capture that experience. A video seemed the most appropriate way to accomplish that. \nThis was my first time painting onto the floor. It added some dynamics that were fun &amp; unexpected. It‚Äôs the biggest painting I‚Äôve ever created. Having more space opened up possibilities to create outside of the abstract of my usual work. I could fully put myself into &amp; onto the canvas. Something I plan on doing much more of. (My past work involved live stage performances using framed canvases half the size of what I used here.)\nCreating from a state of no mind (flow state) allows for magic moments to happen. Giving me the opportunity to be both artist &amp; art observer. An unexpected yet serendipitous win emerged as my body seamlessly integrated into the mountain, underscoring the harmonious connection between the artist and the creation. \nThe accompanying music, recorded in a single take on the guitalele, adds another improvisational dimension to the piece. Sitting on the painting, I cleared my mind, allowing the rhythms of my creation to guide the music. The result is an auditory companion that echoes the spontaneity and magic of the artistic flow.\n&#8220;Mount Annie&#8221; is a multi-sensory experience, a celebration of life&#8217;s peaks, valleys, and the continuous cycle of growth. A reminder that all we‚Äôve learned before adds to the brilliance of who we are now. \nHere‚Äôs a link to a video journal of the whole process from concept to completion if you‚Äôd like to dig deeper: https://youtu.be/Is2q2MfFj94?si=hN5fW2BaMPkRRXJ7\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6821BBAB-6FB0-4019-9653-0C07B8084586-scaled.jpeg,2560,1439,640138,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xd0ef57bd2f2ed0eb47536a245704987b4fe6b7c0/1?referrer=0xb1dc6e4641d4ad094553907af39a97c95d7eb0a3

13150,Art Needs You,"I wrote ‚ÄúArt Needs You‚Äù as a love letter and anthem for the artists and creatives of the world. It‚Äôs a celebration of those who share their inner worlds and ideas and pain through personal creative expression in its myriad forms. And it‚Äôs a reminder that even in our darkest moments, we‚Äôre never truly alone. \nThe creative‚Äôs spirit brings beauty into the world, and for many of us, art is the way we connect with one another. And while art may serve as a refuge or outlet for joy and expression, I also want to illuminate that art needs us. Without those who create it, art ceases to exist. \nWhen I learned about the We Love The Art contest, I was thrilled to see Optimism making such a bold statement about the importance and value of art and creativity in the world of Web3. In kind, I wanted to honor the contest with a submission that vulnerably expresses my own personal relationship with art and creative expression. I‚Äôll add the lyrics below if you‚Äôd like to follow along. \nIn the spirit of sharing art vulnerably, I also used this opportunity to craft the entire song using my voice, leaning into my production skills and various tools within the DAW, Reaper. While everything you hear is my voice, I did employ numerous compressors, EQs, limiters, delays, and reverbs, as well as a ton of editing within my DAW. In addition to my love for singing, I also enjoy the juxtaposition of minting an NFT that features the human voice as the only instrument.\nThe cover image was created using DALL-E 3. It&#8217;s the only AI tool that was used in the creation of this work. \nI wanted the image to emphasize the human need for art, but also lean into the song‚Äôs theme that art needs us, with the sole museum-goer looking up at an enormous painting that boldly states as much. And again, the juxtaposition of using AI to create an image showing art in an art gallery that states that we need art and that art needs was far too fun.\nI hope you enjoy listening to ‚ÄúArt Needs You‚Äù as much as I enjoyed creating it!\n~Joshua\nLyrics:\nSometimes our minds feel shadowed.\nThrough gloom and darkness, we battle the thoughts that invade‚Ä¶\nWith the art that we‚Äôve made.\nSometimes our hearts feel heavy.\nThrough gray sky days, we prime and ready our minds‚Ä¶\nTo create the divine with the colors and code and the sounds and the shapes we align.\nHave you ever wondered if anyone else feels the drive to create like you do?\nHave you ever longed to connect with somebody else who needs art just like you?\nDo you paint hope with pixels?\nBare your soul through pigment?\nDo you render tapestries of the world you would want to live in?\nDo you sing pain to vinyl?\nPrint your heart‚Äôs impression?\nOr is your gallery filled with harmonies of digital expression?\nDo the muses speak inspiration through you?\nGrab your brush, let it flow, and feel that artistic breakthrough.\nArt is life in progress.\nIt‚Äôs where our essence shines through.\nAnd if you feel alone, remember art needs you.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Art-Needs-You-by-Joshua-Du-Chene-Cover-Image.png,1024,1024,1594272,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659c207641fad46b6bc0e21b

13123,Œ±lphachat.6,"Œ±lphachat is a pitch to Subli, and The Optimist, which is a Newsletter about the Optimism Ecosystem. \nI saw that The Optimist came up with this Manifold Submission to the welovetheart contest: \nhttps://app.manifold.xyz/c/thelovecat\nIt&#8217;s a free mint.\nThe benefit of this NFT is a token gated channel in their discord, where community members can share alpha with each other about DeFi Strategies in the Optimism Ecosystem.\nI wanted to expand the functionality of that group by offering another collection, but requiring that this new collection be paid for &#8212; so that capital could be raised in a community owned treasury.\nI used Midjourney to come up with some cats, inspired by Le Chat Noir, because I&#8217;ve always liked that poster, and because Subli is French, and it seemed like the right vibe. \nThere is a neat pun &#8211; &#8220;Alpha Chat&#8221; that I discovered while doing some graphic design work on the &#8220;Le Chat Noir&#8221; for the Logo. \nThis is artwork, but it&#8217;s 100% AI, curated by myself.\nI modified the color &amp; the logo in photoshop.\nThere are 13 NFTs created, and I distributed them to a Multisig, and put Pedro as one of the signers &#8212; the creator of theLoveCat NFT.\nI will also put Subli as a signer, and then remove myself. Once RDF is activated, the treasury becomes either a Moloch DAO, or a Managerial SideCar. \nIf they are interested, I can create more NFTs for the collection, or they can award permissions to another artist who can do Midjourney curation, or paint some Cats.\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/the-optimist-alpha-chat\n.:. \nIf Subli wants to use his newsletter to sell these, the ETH raised will go into the Gnosis Safe: \nhttps://app.safe.global/balances/nfts?safe=oeth:0xBE1FB073491464bb90Bec2FfAD22642f13fe5E0d\nEssentially, it will be The Safe having a sale, to raise funds for itself.\nThe funds can be used to buy veVELO, and extract bribe vAPR each week. \nThe community would be able to use the Moloch RDF Claim app on this collection to activate each NFT by giving them a share. Then, they can use Moloch v3 UI to submit proposals for managing the shared treasury to pursue LP or Yield strategies on Optimism.\nThe Safe will be converted into a Moloch Treasury when the collectors use the RDF Claim App.\n.:. \nIt would also be possible to fair launch an ERC 20 token to NFT holders. \nThe Optimist is a community contribution Newsletter that provides DeFi strategies and information in the form of an email, and podcast. \nIf they had a Fair Launch Token, with DAO owned LP, it would be possible for them to list their token on Velodrome, and then incentivize community contributors for writing articles. \nBuilding veVELO for bribe vAPR could then have another purpose, in voting to direct emissions toward this Research DAO incentive Token.\nThe token itself would also be RQ-enabled, which means it would be deflationary. Holders could burn it for a pro-rata share of the Moloch Treasury.\nThis would turn the Moloch Treasury into a type of Decentralized Hedge Fund | Research Publishing Cooperative.\n.:. \nThe NFT itself is sized to be a Twitter Banner, and it is created using Manifold. \nThe Permissions for the project belong to the Multisig, and to myself, but I can revoke those or create more cats for them, if they want to adopt the project. \nI created this as a pitch to share with Subli so he would understand the project, and how it worked. \nI came up with the idea for this research collective when studying and proposing RDF usage for LobsterDAO. I originally wanted the Lobsters to migrate to OP, and launch a token, to incentivize published research contributions. \nI&#8217;m working on a sales / distribution strategy for the Alchemix project, and was introduced to Subli in a group chat &#8212; so this project is both a pitch and an explainer so that he has an example of what can be done with RDF. \nI enjoyed curating the images, and I think they are all worthy of being twitter headers | membership tokens | advertisements for The Optimist. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7.png,500,1500,865923,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x3400fea116816ee3ec5e20c4d89c3b03fbc7dfae/7

At that time, Kariya was considered one of the satraps of Iran.

A tiny figure nestled on the left, shrouded in black and a touch of mischief. Don&#8217;t be fooled by his nonchalant facade. The Bored Master&#8217;s greatest skill lies in harnessing the very tedium that others dread. He draws upon the well of unease, where stagnation might fester, and from it births wondrous creations. Each stifled yawn, each aimless wander, fuels his inner forge, birthing fantastical flora like the pink blossoms that dance around the stag&#8217;s gentle snout.\nThis, you see, is no ordinary garden. It&#8217;s a kaleidoscope of the mind, where boredom is not a foe, but a catalyst. The Bored Master is a reminder that sometimes, the most fertile ground for growth lies not in bustling activity, but in the quiet hush of introspection. In allowing ourselves to simply be, unfettered by the need for constant stimulation, we open the door to an unexpected kind of magic ‚Äì the magic of letting our imaginations bloom, even in the face of ennui.\nSo, the next time you find yourself battling boredom, remember the Bored Master. Embrace the quiet murmur of your own mind, and who knows what fantastical gardens might blossom within.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_1216.1.jpg,2000,2000,355922,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x441bc38bbb801d20a9e431a6d58b524ee754e64e/1

13105,KRYPTIC DWELLERS,"The collection serves as a visual narrative, unraveling the secrets and conspiracies that surround an elusive group of beings that some refer to as the ‚ÄúDwellers‚Äù. It is a captivating and enigmatic art collection that delves into the realm of pixel art.\nMy creation process centers on making traits on asperite ( which is a tool use to make pixel art). Traits are made in such a way that they don&#8217;t interact negatively which will affect the over all outcome when generated. \nThe collection was generated using Hashlips ArtEngine which is an open source code for developers and artist. It is a tool used to create multiple different instances of artworks based on provided layers that contain traits.\nThe intermittent Development Environment (IDE) I used is visual studio which runs on node.\nHere is the link\nhttps://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine\nMy entry was generated from 7 different layers\nA background (6 traits), skin (8 traits), cloth(10 traits), eyes (12 traits), mouth (7 traits), relics (14 traits) and head piece (6 traits). Total traits made was 63. Using hashlips Art generator tool I established growth size (collection size) as 113. Each trait where assigned weight which affects their rarity, and layers where arranged properly to ensure a proper outcome. The art was then generated which led to 113 outcome of which I have submitted one the rest can be accessed via opensea.\nThe lore surrounding the art work is centered on an imaginary town called &#8220;Plexii&#8221; whose folks have been reporting sightings of strange beings that they rereferred to as the &#8220;Dwellers&#8221;. Each person having different encounters and different stories to tell about these beings. The Dwellers are not just one set of beings but rather different, forming what one can call a clan with each clan having their difference in believe system and core values. There are a total of 8 clans that interact amongst themselves but not with the ordinary folk. Yea conflicts do pop up here and there due to difference in believes but that&#8217;s normal as we all know. And legend has it if you stumble upon the habitat of any of the dwellers it is filled with symbols and relics only the greatest of minds can comprehend.

13095,Mind in Shadows,"In my latest piece, I wanted to capture the essence of the intricate dance between the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the interplay of light and dark, and how it parallels the human mind&#8217;s complexities. My process began with a simple, yet profound idea: to personify the depths of the psyche through a visual medium.\nUsing digital sculpting tools, I shaped a form that emerged from darkness, a metaphor for the emergence of consciousness. The vibrant colors that streak across the face represent the burst of thoughts and emotions that define our inner selves. I chose a contrasting palette to highlight the tension between light and dark, using the power of color to breathe life into the shadows.\nThe grid in the background is a nod to the structured, often confining, nature of our realities. It&#8217;s a world of order that I like to disrupt with the fluid chaos of the mind, depicted by the flowing, colorful patterns. This piece is a dialogue with the viewer, an invitation to ponder what lies beneath the surface of our own eclipsed psyches.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mind-in-Shadows.png,1080,1080,1147453,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x3937ef336634f855dc8b606646a5243d73599dce/1

13068,Female warrior of the red sky,"In the twilight realm of Emberia, where the sky bled crimson every dawn and dusk, lived Kaia, the last daughter of the Crimson Sun Tribe. Born under a moon the color of blood, legend foretold she would be the warrior bathed in celestial fire, defender of the dying flames. Yet, within her veins flowed not just fire, but also the sorrow of a fallen civilization, her tribe dwindled by the Nightwraiths, creatures of obsidian and shadow who feasted on the embers of Emberia.\nKaia trained under the harsh caress of the Red Sky, her skin painted with war paint as vivid as the dying sun. She wielded a spear forged from a fallen star, its tip dancing with celestial flames, and a bow strung with strands of red lightning. Her body became a tempest, swift and strong, her spirit a furnace of defiant hope.\nOne fateful dusk, under a sky stained with the screams of her fallen sisters, the Nightwraiths descended upon the Skyforge, their leader, Mor&#8217;Zhakal, a hulking mass of obsidian claws and echoing darkness. Kaia, a crimson hurricane amidst the falling embers, met them head-on. Her spear sang its fiery song, each thrust splitting shadows and igniting sparks of defiance in the hearts of her remaining kin. Her arrows painted the dying twilight with streaks of lightning, banishing the Nightwraiths back into the encroaching darkness.\nBut Mor&#8217;Zhakal was not easily dismissed. His laughter echoed like cracking glaciers, as he swung a blade wreathed in shadows, threatening to extinguish the last flicker of the Red Sun. It was then that Kaia felt the embers within her ignite, a primal fire whispering ancient secrets. With a scream that rivaled the fury of the sky, she transformed, becoming a creature of pure crimson flame. Her spear became a comet, searing through Mor&#8217;Zhakal&#8217;s darkness, her touch leaving trails of molten light.\nThe battle raged across the Skyforge, the Red Sky echoing with the clash of fire and shadow. Kaia, blazing and unstoppable, pushed Mor&#8217;Zhakal back into the chasm from whence he came.

When we perform ourselves online we‚Äôre in a negotiation with the images we proliferate and the person behind the screen.

13036,artist in iran- salvador dali,"Imagining Salvador Dali in Iran would involve envisioning how the surrealist artist might interact with the culture, scenery, and people of Iran. Keep in mind that Dali lived from 1904 to 1989, and his most active artistic period was during the 20th century. Iran has a rich history, diverse landscapes, and a unique cultural heritage.\nHere&#8217;s a creative scenario:\nIn this imagined scenario, Salvador Dali visits Iran during the 1960s when he was still active in his artistic career. Intrigued by the rich history and vibrant colors of Persian art, Dali is drawn to the ancient city of Isfahan. He strolls through the historic Naqsh-e Jahan Square, inspired by the intricate tilework and the mesmerizing architecture of the Imam Mosque.\nDali, known for his eccentric style, is seen sketching surrealistic interpretations of Persian motifs in his notebook. He is fascinated by the juxtaposition of traditional Persian culture and the avant-garde elements of his own artistic vision. Perhaps he incorporates Persian motifs into his famous melting clocks or uses the intricate patterns in his surrealist landscapes.\nLocal artists and intellectuals in Iran are curious about Dali&#8217;s presence, and a small gathering is arranged where he discusses his unique perspective on art. Dali, always a showman, captivates the audience with his flamboyant personality and eccentric explanations of his surreal creations.\nDuring his stay, Dali also explores the diverse landscapes of Iran, from the deserts to the mountains, finding inspiration for new works. Maybe he even collaborates with local artists, creating a fusion of surrealism and Persian art.\nThis imaginative scenario allows us to picture Salvador Dali embracing the beauty and cultural richness of Iran, blending his surrealistic style with the traditional elements of Persian art.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/msg412097237-663579.jpg,1024,1024,283285,1of1s,"OpenSea,Stability AI",https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x8c029049326058094b9110aa0bbc054912d6b270/3/

12975,Alchemy of Soul,"In the ethereal space where the tangible and intangible converge, the canvas of the &#8220;Alchemy of Soul&#8221; unfolds, a masterpiece born from the alchemical fusion of artistic expression and the essence of the human spirit.\nThis transcendent artwork captures the ineffable journey of the soul&#8217;s evolution through a captivating blend of symbolism and abstraction.\nThe canvas, a tapestry of muted yet vibrant hues, serves as a metaphorical vessel for the alchemical process. Intricate patterns reminiscent of ancient mystic symbols intertwine with fluid strokes that traverse the spectrum of emotion and experience. The color palette, ranging from dark onyx symbolizing introspection to radiant gold representing enlightenment, guides the observer through the transformative stages of the soul&#8217;s alchemy.\nAt the heart of the composition lies a radiant core, a luminous nexus that represents the essence of the soul. Here, abstract forms converge and disperse, creating an ever-shifting dance of light and shadow. This central element invites contemplation on the interconnectedness of the self with the vast, cosmic forces that shape our existence.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alchemy-of-Soul.png,1536,1024,2407811,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x584eaf119524caa2e94b39f3dffea7122cc42b07/4
12973,Philosophy of your life,"I prompted DALL-E with the following:\nWe are going to make another surrealistic painting. In this case, we have a tiled floor, black and white, in large squares, which occupies the entire floor up to the horizon. The sky is a gray sky, uniform. So, for now, the only two colors are black and white on the floor, and the sky is gray. Now, we are going to put a structure on it, as if it was a multi-floor house, but it has no walls. There is only the structure. And you can see the rest of the landscape through the empty walls. On one side of the painting, we put a person, in the attitude of a thinker, sitting on a chair, looking towards the structure. And at the distance, a group of people approaching, without distinguishing themselves very well, only figures. In the sky, instead of the sun we see a clockwork mechanism. Several birds fly, and some others eat something on the tiled floor. Then, where you think it&#8217;s best, place a single door with a frame, opposite to the man thinking of a big yellow sun.\nYou are thinking of sitting by the door. You are thinking about your future, about what you will do with your life. The floor goes in all directions and stretches to all paths. You can choose any path. You can create any path. People scattered by can be friends, family, enemies &#8211; about anyone that passes through your life. Birds are accidents, chances, and opportunities that can change your direction. The mechanism sets the length of your life. You know the clock is working but cannot see when it will stop. But the sun is still shining; you have enough time to move forward, but not all the time in the world.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/puchy_art_2.png,1020,1521,2441402,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xb2040b2d2feb969c6894b118702fd8093834c8ae/2

12965,artist in iran- frida,"If Frida Kahlo were to visit Iran, it would likely be a fascinating and enriching experience for both her and the Iranian people. Frida, known for her vibrant art and strong sense of identity, might find inspiration in the rich history, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes of Iran.\nShe could explore the ancient city of Persepolis, marvel at the intricate architecture of the mosques in Isfahan, and wander through the bustling bazaars of Tehran. The vibrant colors of Iranian carpets, the intricate tile work, and the beauty of Persian calligraphy might captivate her artistic sensibilities.\nFrida might also engage with local artists and artisans, learning about traditional Persian art forms and possibly incorporating some of these influences into her own work. She might be drawn to the symbolism and storytelling inherent in Persian miniature painting or inspired by the geometric patterns in Persian architecture.\nGiven Frida&#8217;s passion for depicting her own experiences and identity, she might also be interested in learning about the lives of Iranian women and the rich tapestry of their stories. Conversations and interactions with locals could provide her with new perspectives to explore in her art.\nIn turn, Frida&#8217;s visit could spark conversations about art, culture, and identity in Iran. The exchange of ideas and the blending of Frida&#8217;s Mexican heritage with Iranian culture could lead to unique artistic expressions and collaborations.\nUltimately, Frida Kahlo&#8217;s visit to Iran would likely be a cultural exchange, a meeting of diverse artistic traditions, and an opportunity for mutual inspiration.\n-This work is made with artificial intelligence of bing.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/msg412097237-663583.jpg,1024,1024,231215,1of1s,"OpenSea,Stability AI",https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x8c029049326058094b9110aa0bbc054912d6b270/1/
12963,Technological Roots,"I prompted DALL-E with the following:\nLet&#8217;s make a surrealistic image. Dark purple sky. The floor is a semi-stony desert. On the horizon, the skyscrapers of a large city can be glimpsed, occupying a third of the horizon. Near the spectator, on the opposite side of the big city is a large, knotty tree that has crooked branches with few metallic leaves, as if they were bronze. Several vines hang from the tree that have a woman trapped by the wrists, who strives to let go. In the foreground, a mobile phone is on the floor. Can you make the floor more yellowish?\nThe skyscrapers in the background represent a modern city. The woman held by the vines and roots represents humanity&#8217;s increasing dependency on technology, to the point that she no longer knows how to work on her own and cannot get rid of her technological assistants (mobile phone on the floor). The tree is not natural, hence its bronze leaves, but corresponds to the essence of technological advancement.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/puchy_art_1.png,1024,1024,2205619,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xb2040b2d2feb969c6894b118702fd8093834c8ae/1
12960,The New Alchemist: Inventing Digital Gold from Silicon,"The name I chose for this artwork (The New Alchemist) is a visual metaphor, embodying the transformative power of innovation and the enigmatic figure of Satoshi Nakamoto. As the creator of this artwork, I sought to encapsulate the pivotal moment in financial history where the traditional concept of money began to morph into something entirely new ‚Äî the birth of cryptocurrency.\nSatoshi Nakamoto, portrayed here in quiet contemplation, is the quintessential modern alchemist, transmuting the abstract into tangible value. He sits before an array of screens, not unlike the arcane instruments of medieval alchemists, orchestrating the creation of Bitcoin. The digital charts and graphs are the new symbols of wealth, the new philosopher&#8217;s stone.\nThe backdrop of the cityscape, with its towering monoliths of financial institutions, contrasts the old with the new, the physical with the digital. The newspaper, heralding the famous message Satoshi put in the genesis block (The Times Jan/03/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks), is a stark reminder of the fragility of traditional finance, and the spark that ignited the revolution that is cryptocurrency.\nThrough the process of bringing this piece into life, I imbued the scene with layers of symbolism. The cluttered desk, the scattered books, and the intensity of Nakamoto&#8217;s focus represent the chaotic yet purposeful process of creation. The window serves as a portal between two worlds ‚Äî the one we&#8217;ve always known and the one that is emerging.\nThis piece asks the viewer to deeply question the nature of value, the trust we place in unseen and intangible forces, and the future of currency. It is a reflection on the power of human ingenuity to redefine the essence of wealth and the daring of one individual to challenge the status quo. As you stand before this work, consider the alchemy of the 21st century: not turning lead into gold, but encryption into economy.\nP.S: This artwork is fully generated by Dall-E (an OpenAI product).\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The_New_Alchemist-scaled.jpeg,2560,2560,1539935,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xcb71b9fd00cf037d0a91e6a2f6e80230814ea621/2

12948,Technology and the future,"I prompted DALL-E with the following:\nWe are going to make a surrealistic landscape. A soft blue, blue sky with clouds. In it, a radiant sun. A calm sea, without waves, extensive. And a smooth sandy beach. Although there are clouds, everything is well-lit. Still on the side and backwards, we have a watchmaking mechanism or the huge type of watchmaking. Nearby, a sunflower with a bluish center. Both the sunflower and the watchmaking mechanism are very large and important. Some pebbles on the beach. A hammer thrown on the floor. A denture on the side. Also a skull. And some black birds flying over towards the horizon and the sun.\nIt is a very illuminated landscape, especially on the horizon. The birds are going in that direction, indicating a light of hope in that direction. On the contrary, the vicinity of the front is desolate. Abandoned things, hammers, glasses, and a skull indicate that this area is exhausted. Even the sunflower, with its bluish color, suggests a genetic modification to adapt to hostile places. The mechanism indicates that man has found a technological solution, which apparently has raised the possibility of life. In reality, the landscape should suggest the passage of time in terrestrial existence, with the remains thrown by the past to the front while the present and the future are developing backwards on the horizon.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/puchy_art_0.png,1021,1514,2549486,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x1e96db9a2722cd495d4b888a524c10e34272c66f/3?referrer=0x0081e6f9373c1ffB7D7FC702EB15aC805EB50389

12942,The Quiet Revolution: A New Ledger Begins,"This design is a visual symphony of the silent yet seismic shift in global finance, instigated by the enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This piece captures the moment of profound change‚Äîa revolution not shouted in the streets, but whispered in the binary code of an emerging digital currency.\nAs the artist, I sought to envelop Satoshi in a cocoon of contemplation amidst the chaos of the financial district, a stark contrast to the turmoil outside. The year 2009 on the ticker is deliberate, marking the genesis of Bitcoin, a response to the financial instability illuminated by the newspaper headline (The famous message in the Genesis Block). This is the year the world&#8217;s first cryptocurrency was born, promising a decentralized future and heralding the quiet collapse of traditional financial dogmas.\nThe interior is rich with symbolism: the globe, an old world of borders giving way to the borderless realm of digital currency; the scattered books and papers, knowledge once bound, now freed into the digital ether; the monitor, portal to the new frontier of finance. Each element serves as a narrative thread in the tapestry of this financial revolution.\nThe Quiet Revolution is not only aesthetically beautiful, it is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of money, the power of technology, and the concept of value. It is a statement about the silent power of innovation to disrupt and redefine.\nTo the discerning jury, I present this work as a conversation between the past and the future, between upheaval and the calm at the eye of the storm, between the noise of the market and the quiet resolve of a revolutionary idea.\nP.S: This artwork is fully generated by Dall-E (an OpenAI product).\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The_Quiet_Revolution.png,1680,2944,8653977,1of1s,Manifold,https://titles.xyz/collect/zora/0xc985a43305c78c7B15E7a59Da76c95E788dea25f

12915,MBTI Brain Mazes DID: Personality that changes over time,"The &#8220;MBTI Brain Mazes DID&#8221; collection embodies an evolving portrayal of personality, manifesting through the lens of digital art. In this endeavor, the creation process began with an interplay of technology and human creativity. Utilizing Midjourney as a generative muse, various brain-inspired images were conceived. These digital inspirations served as a foundational blueprint, subsequently transformed through the meticulous hand-drawing capabilities of Procreate. The artistic vision was clear: to craft a brain-shaped maze, epitomizing simplicity through solid colors and a minimalist approach.\nArtistically, this collection draws from the vibrant dynamism of Mr. Doodle (Sam Cox), a luminary in British graffiti art, and the iconic boldness of Keith Haring, an American New Pop artist. Their influence is evident in the simplicity, playfulness, and chromatic vibrancy that permeate the series.\nCentral to the collection&#8217;s concept is the analogy of the brain to a labyrinthine maze. Adopting the brain maze isomorphism, the series presents a unique brain design for each of the 16 MBTI personality types, unveiling distinct identities and traits associated with each. This artistic representation echoes the complexity and multifaceted nature of human psychology.\nFrom a first-person perspective, the creation process was a journey of discovery and innovation. The interplay of automated image generation and manual artistic refinement was not just a method but an exploration of the boundaries between artificial intelligence and human creativity. The result is a series that is as much a reflection of the artist&#8217;s vision as it is of the technological tools that helped shape it.\nIn the realm of blockchain technology, this collection takes a novel approach. The smart contract code generates a random tokenURI for each Non-Fungible Token (NFT), based on the sender&#8217;s address (msg.sender) and the timestamp of the transaction. \n‚ÄúThis mechanism ensures that different viewers see varying metadata for the same MBTI tokenURI.‚Äù\nThis design choice is not arbitrary; it symbolizes the fluidity of personality traits. Just as a person may exhibit extroverted tendencies in moments of joy and introverted in times of adversity, so too does the displayed MBTI vary, reflective of the dynamic and diverse nature of human personality.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/all-mbti-nft.png,1327,1323,889598,1of1s,OpenSea,https://www.sound.xyz/playlist/d81b6ba3-0afe-4367-9f7c-aa341344f8d4

People may be influenced by their feelings when making decisions about investing in digital currencies, while the mind, as the representative of logic and analysis, decides based on available information and data.\nThis conflict can create contradictions in investment choices; sometimes, the heart invests in a digital currency based on intuition and emotions, while the mind considers risk and profit.\nThe dichotomy between the heart and the mind in cryptocurrency may remind us of how our decisions in the digital world can still be influenced by emotions, even though it seems that the mind, grounded in data, makes the decisions.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7232bf4a-65ec-40db-9039-25fde34bf9c5.jpg,1024,1024,188745,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x8bF30E0d62695acBd9557BeC48151800DdE6b2BF

12901,MEGAxis: First OP AI Prompt NFT,"We believe that AI and Web3 together can bring unprecedented changes to the online economy. In the use case of the generative AI industry, it will be exciting to create a prompt marketplace on a decentralized chain, fueled and sustained by Web3 tokenomics.\nMEGAxis team observed a huge potential market for prompt engineers in the future. As OpenAI, Midjourney and many other AI generative tools have taken the stage recently, we see the rampant growth in demand for high-quality prompts that can help train AI models to produce accurate and useful results. However, creating effective prompts requires a deep understanding of the nuances of language and context, as well as the large language model . It can be a challenging task to craft prompts that are precise and unambiguous. Furthermore, developing effective prompts is not a one-time task. As AI models continue to learn and evolve, there is a need for ongoing refinement and optimization of prompts. Talents will be urgently needed to craft good prompts.\nTokenizing prompts can actualize the potential market. MEGAxis can create a marketplace where prompt engineers can earn tokens for creating and selling high-quality prompts. The better their prompts perform, the more valuable their tokens become. MEGAxis can also use Web3 tokenomics to create a community around the platform. For example, users who hold tokens could be given voting rights on platform decisions, upvote and downvote prompts. This not only makes the platform more fun for users, but also encourages community engagement and investment in the platform&#8217;s success.\nThe industrial value of tokenizing prompts is that it will make the AI industry fairer, more accurate, and more efficient. MEGAxis creates a level playing field where developers of all sizes can contribute to the industry and earn income from their work. This can also allow developers to build upon existing prompts, avoid common mistakes, and refine their models to be more accurate. By using existing NFTs and building on them to create more advanced models, developers can save time, reduce costs, and ultimately lead to faster development of AI models.\nProject Demo: http://54.250.82.236:8080\nSmart Contract: https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x3967c2DcA56Bf119e0473Df86760e9a35e4e616C?tab=contract\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/aipromptnft

Thank you.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rv0y2onhEdK7AfQD3T2LqRAAy4s4AXlGIHqNv97rIUA/edit?usp=sharing\nEther Armor : Optimism #43\nThis project uses AI to create each part. Then the image that is obtained is put into various conditions that we have set.\nTools used to create\nAI : Dream , Playground\nDream : Used to create sword, helmet, eyes, horns, armor, wings\nPlayground : Background\nConcept :\nThe human world is rapidly evolving when AI comes in to help with work. And only a few years later, AI had learned all about the world. In the year 2095, humans and AI designed a suit of armor to travel the universe and explore other stars. The armor is designed to be used in all weather conditions, divided into land, water, and air exploration suits, and there is a special suit called &#8220;God&#8221; which is a special treasure search suit. This set is one of them. And after completing their exploration, they will take the information and things they have found back to the human world for further study and development.\nWhat I think stands out and is different from other works created by ai.\nThe sword and horn are quite unique because both the horn and the sword glow. If you look carefully at both the armor and helmet. I&#8217;ll try to put some neon lights in there. to look different It&#8217;s almost a neon project because almost every piece has light somewhere. And what is indispensable is the background that must blend in with the armor. and makes the armor stand out\nColor tones: blue, red, white, green, dark, gold, fluorescent\nCharacter design and various elements\nStart by drawing the picture that you want to be the prototype and inserting the prompt that you want. Then generate images in the Dream app by selecting the images that we like the most. Then correct it so that the left and right sides are equal. Adjust the color and match the armor as much as possible to make it as harmonious as possible. The hardest thing is choosing the pieces you like. and the most complete to use\nIf we get the piece we want, we have to check if our work is similar to someone else&#8217;s by using image search on Google and Pinterest. If any picture is similar or close to someone else&#8217;s picture, we will delete it immediately without regret. wasted time\nDesign\nHelmets &#8211; I tried to keep the helmets mostly white. and try to put neon lights in any part The bottom of the helmet is also illuminated to differentiate it from the armor beneath.\nEyes &#8211; Only two primary colors are used: blue and gold. and to make the eyes stand out I also made my eyes glow.\nHorn &#8211; Must not block the sword or wings behind him too much. This horn therefore has a bent shape and points towards the sky. And only three colors: blue, red, black.\nArmor &#8211; Besides being beautiful, we want it to be compatible with the helmet. so that when put together it still looks normal\nSword &#8211; which is my favorite and most prominent part of the collection. If you look carefully, the sword has a white character in the middle of the sword that glows.\nWings &#8211; This is another difficult part to make. Because it was difficult to find compatibility with the armor. Therefore, we used a white-gray color to blend well with most armor sets. and uses a curry color to match the black and red armor.\nBackground &#8211; According to the concept, what I had in mind was to explore various places in the universe, including underwater, and many places that unravel the world. There are many weather conditions. The design aspect is to blend in and make the characters stand out. So I tried to make the side edges darker than usual.\nI put a lot of thought into each piece. And if you zoom in to see the details, you will see that the lines of each piece are also cut. Partly to separate the characters from the background.\nWhen all the various parts are assembled, it will look like this.\nDivided into 5 color tones :\nUsing conditions to generate tokens\nSome examples : 7 Traits\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Blue.png,1080,1080,2170153,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xbf1c2fb24f6df2043b1bf7c70eafb19d91b3b1ac/43
12857,Ruby Radiance,"Ruby Radiance explores the interplay of colors and emotions. The concept behind this piece is to capture the essence of individuals through vibrant red hues, symbolizing love, passion, and vitality.\nIn terms of process, I utilized Adobe Illustrator as my primary tool. The digital platform allowed me to intricately craft each stroke, creating a seamless blend of form and color. The layered approach in Illustrator enabled me to build depth and complexity, adding richness to the overall composition.\nThe inspiration for &#8216;Ruby Radiance&#8217; stems from a fascination with the emotive power of red and the desire to convey a sense of resilience and beauty in the portrait.

Every moment is precious ‚Äì life is precious. So, what am I going to do on this blank page? How am I going to fill my days? Do I leave my destiny up to fate or do I take actions in my hand? Will I take flight? Or am I too scared of failing?\nIt is when I hear lyrics like these that I get perspective again. It is when I turn off the noise, and turn on the truth, that I remember who I am. It is thanks to these songs that I find myself again when ‚Äúlife happens‚Äù and I get messed- up and wrapped up in all the mundane.\nJust like a bird doesn‚Äôt fly in a day, and it will fall a few times, I fall, too. I have fallen multiple times. Probably you as well. Yet, by now I am sure that I will get up again. However, If you fall, don‚Äôt let it change your mind. My mind is set.

There are different layers of representation throughout the piece as the physical tree and the cosmic tree are always interwoven. Thus there is a continuous movement between the apparent reality and the surrealistic world.\nIt has been created in three distinctive parts. \nThe first (0:00 to 10:40) is an acousmatic piece, starting with the cracking of the seed, and figuring the growing of the tree. It has been composed by a microediting technique of only microphonic sound, mostly wood pieces and branches. \nThe tree grows towards a forest, and the second part represent the forest itself (10:30 to 20:00). It was again composed by mostly microphonic sound taken from the primal forest of Sarawak on the Island of Borneo.\nThe sound of the forest is slowed down, and underlined with very specific pure tones (analog sine waves) to create a beating effect between the organic forest and the synthetic analog sounds.\nThe third part sees the arrival of music instruments, such as piano, vibraphone, guitar and voices. This is the introduction of the next section (L‚ÄôARBRE 2) which will later be released later this year as an orchestral piece of a song which can already be heard in a live version here\n\nThis third part respresents the journey towards a unified consciousness.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arbre-4-scaled.jpg,2560,2560,1431306,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/mathiasdurand/larbre-part-1

This artwork is not merely a visual chronicle but a philosophical exploration of humanity&#8217;s relentless quest to transcend its origins and redefine its destiny.\nEach panel is an epoch in itself, a narrative that begins with the primal spark of discovery in the prehistoric dawn. It progresses through the ingenuity of the wheel, the mastery of fire, the dawn of agriculture, all monumental strides that have shaped human society. Each step on this journey reflects our innate urge to understand and manipulate our environment, leading to the creation of tools, culture, and ultimately, our own mechanical progeny.\nThe central figure, a humanoid robot, stands as the penultimate creation, a mirror reflecting the cumulative knowledge of ages past. It gazes upon the legacy of its makers, embodying the pinnacle of our technological achievements while posing silent inquiry into its role in this grand narrative. Does it stand as the final act of humanity&#8217;s creativity, or the first step towards a new definition of life?\nThe background is a convergence of our triumphs and follies. From the serene to the catastrophic, it encapsulates the potential for both creation and destruction that technology harbors. The stark juxtaposition of a flourishing future cityscape against the ominous mushroom cloud serves as a potent reminder of the dual-edged sword that is progress.\nThrough &#8220;Inquiry of the Invented&#8221;, I invite the viewer to ponder the questions that lie at the heart of our human experience. What is the endgame of our inventive spirit? How do we navigate the fine line between enhancing our lives through technology and preserving the essence of our human experience? As creators of the artificial, how do we prepare for the potential of our own inventions to surpass us in intellect and perhaps, autonomy? How does our evolutionary journey inform the ethics of creating life not born of flesh but forged in silicon and steel?

12727,Optimal Laughter,"The core idea of my artwork is a captivating reimagining of clowns. I have always been intrigued by the duality of clowns‚Äîsymbols of joy for some and fear for others. So, I thought: what if clowns were the guardians of the people? My aim was to flip the narrative, making clowns the fearless fighters against the threats in a dystopian world, hence changing the ingrained fear into a sentiment of trust and safety.\nTo breathe life into this concept, I harnessed the storytelling power of ChatGPT. It was like having a conversation with creativity itself‚Äîbouncing ideas back and forth, refining the lore, and solidifying the backdrop of each character&#8217;s existence. ChatGPT&#8217;s role was to help me knit a detailed and engaging background for the characters, one where their transition from human to heroic clown was both believable and profound.\nThe visual representation was born from Dall-E, an AI that generates images from text prompts. It&#8217;s a remarkable tool that took my descriptions and spun them into complex, colorful visuals of my clown characters. Yet, the AI-generated images were just the beginning. I took these creations and brought them into Photoshop, where I could add my personal touch‚Äîrefining colors, sharpening details, and enhancing textures to achieve the exact look and feel I envisioned. This step was crucial, as it allowed me to imprint my artistic signature on each piece, marrying AI&#8217;s generative abilities with my creative vision and technical skills.\nThe final pieces are a symbiosis of AI ingenuity and human artistry‚Äîa series that not only showcases clowns as the new-age champions of humanity but also highlights the transformative power of technology in the hands of a creative. I hope this redefined image of clowns brings a sense of awe and wonder, altering age-old perceptions.\nIf you&#8217;re curious about the tools that played a part in this creative journey, you can check out ChatGPT for its narrative genius and Dall-E for its initial image generation capabilities. And of course, the indispensable Photoshop, which I used to polish and perfect the artwork, is a testament to the enduring relevance of human touch in art.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Liquid-Laughter-V24.png,1024,1024,2274455,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x74790f4369202f60b00d906a26e7f3643a41ed4b/1

12614,Rainscapes,"CONCEPT\nThe submission contains link to artwork of Rainscape #1\nRainscapes is a collection of fully on-chain artworks of generative rain. The rain unfolds through the continuous block production of Optimism blockchain. As Optimism blockchain produces a new block every two seconds, a new drop of rain is produced to each of the tokens.\nEvery time a new block is produced in Optimism, it translates into drops of rain. Each block is represented by its corresponding blockhash fragment, which is distributed across the 64 Rainscape tokens creating unique rain patterns not only on individual tokens but across the entire collection. The mechanism is uniquely designed to Optimism blockchain, which allows runtime access to blockhash history for up to 10.000 blocks (in comparison to max. 256 blocks in Ethereum mainnet)\nEach individual rainscape token collects recent blockhashes and distills thems into raindrops from its particular fragment of token hash. Most importantly all visuals for the artwork are generated in Optimism&#8217;s EVM runtime using Solidity. The playback function is provided on top of the EVM runtime for convenience and for observing the ambience of the rain, generated from the latest blocks.\nEach token is assigned unique properties, representing familiar environments and elements. Biomes dictate the colorscape and precipitation, while the four elements determine raindrop symbols. Tokens fuse biomes with element symbols, generating unique rainscapes that recreate the ambience of that particular combination.\nThe ambience is complemented by a rain-like soundscape. The sound in itself is synthesized in browser, while the parameters that shape the sound are dynamic and created on EVM runtime with Solidity. Over time, the sounds change, reflecting seasonal variations that shape the overall auditory experience.\nRainscapes is considered &#8220;net art&#8221; designed for representation and showcasing on digital screens. The artwork, based on vectorized graphics in SVG, can be scaled to infinitely high resolutions. When the animation view is opened, it can be turned into full-screen mode by pressing the &#8220;F&#8221; key. The easiest way to see the animation in full screen is to open the original animation view in the Manifold gallery, which allows for interactions.\nThe tokens can be viewed as art individually as well as a collection. As a collection the tokens form a superstructure, through the relationship they have as rain filters for the incoming blockhashes as well as their spatial assignments (X / Y / Z coordinates).\nThe submitted Rainscape #1 represents the first of the rainscape tokens, depicting rain on a blockhash fragment consisting of the lowest bits of the blockhash. Raindrop positions and shapes are determined by these lowest bits. Token #1 features unique properties generated through an on-chain rarity distribution, representing a Rainforest with the element of fire. The token can be viewed as is or using playback with sound, offering continuous observability to block hash generation through the rain.\nPROCESS AND TOOLS\nRainscape was minted through Manifold using a creator contract. A set of custom smart contracts were implemented on top, allowing the creation of a generative\nseries using fully on-chain artworks on Manifold. Development utilized Foundry + Forge. The full source code alongside supplementary materials is available both on request and publicly on Github at:\nhttps://github.com/tokenfox/rainscapes-contracts\nFirst contract we developed is a Manifold extension called GenerativeSeriesExtension. This extension allowed the configuration and minting of exactly 64 tokens and facilitated the harvesting of token hashes from mint transactions. While not recommended for reuse without auditing/code reviewing, the extension itself is a novel contribution to the Manifold and Optimism ecosystem. To address mutability concerns post-mint, the extension includes freezability, enabling artists to freeze the implementation once considered final, providing immutability and finality sought by on-chain art collectors. Deployment and source of the extension can be found from:\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x675a1354cE3715a8B69E775563b7aCa66C0aB4ED#code\nThe second contract, the core of the artwork, is called RainscapesRenderer. The renderer translates token hashes into properties, collecting dynamic properties forming the generative artwork. The renderer includes smart contracts such as on-chain trait generators (RainscapesTraits and TraitsWithRarity) and extension points for smaller updates. Noteworthy technical features include 1) read-gas adaptive artworks to prevent out-of-gas scenarios (RainscapesObservatory), 2) usage of a Solidity-based trigonometry library for 3D projection and flow fields, and 3) on-chain rarity-based trait assignment. As the renderer is replaceable, it can be upgraded overtime. At the moment the most recent version can be found from:\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9cf22A4C8Ee69cF7dC6008D97209d646Ae62D9a0#code\nThird contract, RainscapesObservatory, is closely related to renderer. An often-underappreciated aspect of on-chain art is optimization for read gas. Retrieving most artworks using public RPC endpoints is challenging, making it difficult for collectors to verify returns from the chain. Rainscapes addresses this with a technical solution akin to &#8220;graceful degradation&#8221; from the web landscape. If ample read gas is available, a high-resolution version of the artwork is returned on tokenURI call. If read gas is limited, the returned artwork adapts to available gas, attempting to provide the best possible version within constraints. An initial version of this adaptor has been implemented and deployed at: \nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x37062DE7dE493360c3963DC413344599341493f5#code\nThe fourth contract, RainscapesMinter, is a minting extension. It was implemented to allow arbitrary minters to mint tokens to the creator contract through the generative series extension. Deployment is available at:\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x6f89edc035af8610d085ad23d8b6981f278ee365#code\nFifth and final contract is, RainsScapesData, a supplementary data contract. This data contract allows developer ergonomic access, allowing developers to build customizations on top of the Rainscapes token data. The methods include access to on-chain generated images, animations, JSON data as well as full token URIs of each individual token. Latest deployment is available at:\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x07e339bdc0969cb81f84e407688c4c0c51d73d39#code\nIn addition to smart contract work, the artwork has been integrated into ENS domain name system, allowing for real time access to all artworks through rainscapes.eth domain name. For instance token #1 can be accessed real-time using URL:\nhttps://rainscapes.w3eth.io/tokenHTML/1\nTechnically, Rainscapes can be considered fully on-chain artwork or, using the term &#8220;in-chain,&#8221; as they are fully rendered within the EVM equivalent runtime of Optimism mainnet. All data, including metadata, thumbnail images, and animations, is retrieved and returned in standard tokenURI calls, making the artworks qualify as 3/3 stars in dhof&#8217;s &#8220;Michelin Guide to On-Chain NFTs&#8221; and receiving a perfect 5/5 score in On-Chain Checker (onchainchecker.xyz).\nLINKS\nCollection website: https://tokenfox.eth.limo/\nCollection in Opensea: https://opensea.io/collection/rainscapes\nToken #1 in Opensea: https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x199d0b700b64dcc07cf991cf630a373f27bfb1b8/1\nToken #1 in Manifold Gallery: https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x199d0b700b64dcc07cf991cf630a373f27bfb1b8/1\nToken #1 in real-time: https://rainscapes.w3eth.io/tokenHTML/1\nFull source code: https://github.com/tokenfox/rainscapes-contracts\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rainscapes-1.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x199d0b700b64dcc07cf991cf630a373f27bfb1b8/1

12600,Head of the Table at the Banquet of the Mind,"Title of Artwork: Head of the Table at the Banquet of the Mind\nConcept: The artwork stands as a metaphorical representation of a mental symposium, where each fragment and layer portrays a guest &#8211; a thought, emotion, or memory. The dominant elements in the composition symbolise the prevailing ideas or memories, serving as the &#8216;head of the table&#8217; in the cerebral banquet. The abstract nature invites introspection, with each viewer drawing unique connections based on their individual experiences.\nVisual Description: The piece presents a chaotic yet harmonious collision of images and colours, with a vivid pink background suggesting a dreamy, subconscious realm. Photographic prints interweave with abstract shapes, while red electrical tape boldly crosses through the composition, creating a visual rhythm that guides the viewer&#8217;s eye across the canvas. The layering technique is visible, with acetate adding a translucent depth, while spray and acrylic paints introduce textural diversity and a burst of colour.\nProcess: This artwork&#8217;s process involved a meticulous layering technique. The initial layer of found photographic images sets a historical and reflective tone. Upon this, acetate sheets were overlaid, creating a sense of obscured clarity, much like the filtering of memories through consciousness. The use of electrical tape introduces a graphic element, segmenting the composition and injecting a contemporary edge. Spray paint was strategically applied to introduce a spontaneous, almost accidental quality, simulating the serendipitous nature of thought. Acrylic paints were the final touch, employed for their rich colour and the ability to unite disparate elements into a cohesive whole.\nTools Used:\n&#8211; Photographic prints and found images, which create a nostalgic and contemplative base.\n&#8211; Electrical tape, adding bold, linear elements that contrast with the underlying images.\n&#8211; Acetate sheets, providing semi-transparency and depth, like the veils of consciousness.\n&#8211; Spray paint, offering texture and a spontaneous feel, symbolizing fleeting thoughts or ideas.\n&#8211; Acrylic paint, used for detailed work and to bring the piece to life with vibrant colours.\nThe resulting artwork is a complex, multi-layered piece that delves into the psyche&#8217;s depths, inviting the viewer to reflect on the fleeting and persistent thoughts that occupy the mind&#8217;s table. The physical layering of materials reflects the layering of thoughts, memories, and emotions within the human experience, making &#8220;Head of the Table at the Banquet of the Mind&#8221; a profound visual exploration of the inner self.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Banquet-of-the-Mind.png,1846,1374,5944733,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xcd61b4d2c839b481ddecc442e0f4da88f297e6e4/2
12599,terra0: Zero Percent,"terra0 has issued an NFT (ERC721 Token) representing a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite scan of Antarctic sea ice and created a smart contract that takes the input of the Antarctic sea ice extent as measured by NASA. If this value falls to zero percent, the token will be automatically burned.\nZero Percent addresses the relationship between global warming and the critical survival of the represented (eco)systems in an obvious way: Through a simple condition, the work will only exist as long as there is some Antarctic sea ice; the NFT and the SAR measurement of the monitored ice will disappear when the real ice disappears. The work also addresses the speculation of the art world in the context of an increasingly rapidly changing world and deteriorating environmental conditions, and can thus be seen as a blueprint for how artists can use their agency to gain political influence through the creation of potential assets and speculative objects. While this is to be understood as a metaphor in a specific case, it is also a proposal for mechanisms to incentivize owners to act consciously in the future.\n* The antarctic sea ice extend data is from nasa and can be viewed here: https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo/data/current-state-sea-ice-cover\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zero_percent.jpg,2000,2000,860048,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0xbb17fdc1902da71b06572defccfbaf69f8d02596/1

12585,Embracing Ethereum&#8217;s Optimistic Canvas,"This artwork is exclusively generated by AI, and I dedicated considerable effort to ensure that the intricate details were produced entirely by the AI without any subsequent editing\n I utilized various available AI sites such as Bing, DALL-E, and ImagnAI. The depiction of this female creature symbolizes Ethereum, and to align with the Ethereum logo, I incorporated the colors Hex:12100B and Hex:3D3E3F (black and grey).\nThis artwork visually conveys the concept of Optimism as a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It illustrates the process of executing transactions through a dynamic composition:\n1. Red Blocks Connecting Through Head:\nThe red blocks represent batches of off-chain computations, including executed transaction data and smart contracts. They connect through the head, symbolizing the transaction processing that occurs off-chain in the Optimistic Rollup system.\n2. Moving to Ethereum Chain:\nThe visual narrative shows these red blocks moving towards the Ethereum chain, emphasizing the movement of transaction data from the Optimistic Rollup chain to the Ethereum main chain. This highlights the off-chain nature of the majority of computations.\n3. Red Circle at the Core:\n The central red circle, shining like the sun, symbolizes the heart of Ethereum. It represents the source of data availability and security. This emphasizes the critical role of Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 1 in ensuring the security and transparency of transactions on the Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup chain.\n4. Trustworthiness and Decentralization:\n The overall composition communicates the trustworthiness and decentralization inherent in the Optimistic Rollup system. By relying on Ethereum&#8217;s main chain for data availability and security, the artwork emphasizes the system&#8217;s integrity and reliability.\n5. Transaction Gas Fee System:\n Additionally, the artwork touches on the concept of transaction gas fees on Optimism, distinguishing between L2 execution fees (red blocks) and L1 security fees (grey blocks). This visual representation adds depth to the understanding of the cost structure associated with executing transactions on the Optimistic Rollup system.\nto sum up: the artwork serves as a visual metaphor for the Optimistic Rollup concept, depicting the interplay between off-chain computations, Ethereum&#8217;s core security, and the overall trustworthiness and decentralization of the system.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/optimism-l2.jpg,1024,1024,185600,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xed43dcbd7cc421a7be1bef1bf10348667e65c828/1

The beige and brown environment with cracked ice walls signifies the fragility of life, while the flowing lava beneath suggests hidden intensity beneath the surface. The key on the reflective floor becomes a symbol of hope amid uncertainties, unlocking revelations within personal stories. The central figure, a soul with a white lotus on her head, embodies vulnerability and strength. The interaction within the cosmic tear speaks to the universal human experience of seeking connection beyond physical limits. The red threads symbolize invisible ties binding souls across time and space, weaving a fabric of enduring human relationships. The narrative suggests a yearning for a love that transcends physical constraints, it echoes the desire for a guardian presence to provide solace in life&#8217;s challenges.

Against a dark backdrop, two strategically placed dots subtly hint at the form of a cat, sparking a deliberate ambiguity open to interpretation.\nThe essence of this piece lies in its role as a commentary on the delicate relationship between the viewer and the artist, transforming it into a performance of sorts. Its purpose is to observe how viewers perceive and interpret the piece. During its first digital exhibition on a social platform, interesting debates unfolded regarding whether the image truly depicted a cat or perhaps some other predator. Opinions varied widely ‚Äî some perceived a friendly feline, while others envisioned a more menacing creature. There were even interpretations suggesting the dots were not representative of an animal but rather distant points of light.\nInterestingly, the true title of the piece became secondary, eclipsed by the diverse interpretations of the audience. This performance, staged through the piece‚Äôs exhibition, has offered valuable insights. As the artist, I have come to a profound understanding of the essence of art ‚Äî to pose questions. It serves as a catalyst, compelling consumers of my work to ponder the ‚Äòwhy,‚Äô ‚Äòwhat,‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô aspects, going beyond the conventional boundaries of artistic expression\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2C6D7386-EDF0-4F4E-93C0-5D498934DB9E.png,2160,1620,72043,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x093e3b4eb4a37d5b26a18a79dc195f4cc20232eb/1/

I named the 30 characters based on the names of the 30 coins I chosed in the story\nStep3. For each NFT character, I have to describe their personality and role in the Cryptal world more about them\nStep4. Come up with an idea for drawing an NFT: create the main parts into a Form, eyes into different emotions, crowns or hats and small accessories, the special thing here is that each character will have a type of shirt and costume different outfits and hairstyles that I designed specifically for them,\nFinally, the color must correspond to the color of the coin that character represents\nIII.

I&#8217;ve produced music for 10+ years utilizing Ableton live. In addition to that, I utilize tools such as photoshop, illustrator, midjourney, and procreate to create my cover art and golden egg gifs. When that is all said and done I also dive into adobe premiere to create marketing resources (such as quick clips) to draw in potential fans.\nWith all this said and done, this is just the beginning. I&#8217;m already one of the first artists on Bitcoin (~100k inscription mark), and intend to create another imprint like that on other chains with music.\nI appreciate each and every one of the judges. Without you none of this would be possible, and because of you us artists have a chance at creating dreams into reality&#8230; That said, if I win I intend to take 100% of the prize money and reinject it back the soundxyz ecosystem.

12436,Interstellar (ISTLR),"Meet the first co-creative NFT collection powered by user interaction through ChatGPT via X Polls.\nHow it works:\nAfter providing the opening chapter as the initial data input, ChatGPT is tasked with creating three possible continuations of the storyline. All three potential continuations are then posted on https://twitter.com/ISTLRNFT, and everyone is invited to choose their preferred option. The scenario with the most votes will guide ChatGPT in crafting the next chapter. Additionally, ChatGPT will capture all main events in an NFT, creating an expanding NFT collection chapter by chapter. This approach empowers users to actively participate in the creation process, essentially transforming them into co-creators of a dynamically evolving NFT collection. An illustration of this co-creation process can be found in this super thread: https://twitter.com/ISTLRNFT/status/1744323272722780170\nGenesis art work:\nIn contrast to all future NFT designs, the NFT collection submitted today was created with Midjourney instead of ChatGPT and DALL-E. That&#8217;s because when I started the project, ChatGPT could not produce AI-generated pictures within the chat flow, and apparently, Midjourney offers more detailed characteristics, which allowed me to better embrace diversity among the crew members. Hence, I was able to represent multiple ethnicities, females, males, and transgender individuals when designing the crew.\nThe aim of the first drop is to attract a broad, diverse user community and involve them in the project. Future NFT designs, which are based on the subsequent chapters, will be more generic and produced via ChatGPT to streamline the process in general.\nAll the artwork generated by me via Midjourney can be found in their Discord (https://discord.gg/midjourney) if you search for my Discord name. For that, just put my Discord name (marsvikings) in the search bar on the top right. My Discord user ID is: 835196952529731605.\nPlease note that this is the very first time the artwork got minted, there was no previous deployment whatsoever. I started creating the art work a while ago and added step by step a piece of the puzzle until I stumbled across your website a couple of days ago. Since then I am busy finalizing the project. I just finished every detail today and that&#8217;s exactly when the artwork was minted or published in any way for the very first time.\nMotivation and vision:\nAs you read this, Earth&#8217;s atmosphere continues to heat up at an alarming rate. While rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions are destroying entire ecosystems, a rapid decline in soil fertility threatens our food security. Without a change in our current trajectory, we will soon face some serious problems. I believe that only by rediscovering our capacity for collaboration and by embracing nature&#8217;s full diversity can we move together towards a more sustainable future.\nBy confronting the audience with the consequences of environmental inaction in the opening story, I hope that the audience understands what actually is at stake and starts to value our precious and unique home planet again. Additionally, by enabling the audience to co-design the storyline, I hope to increase their involvement with this subject and foster a sense of environmental responsibility.\nThis being said, as the concept of co-creation requires me to surrender control of the storyline to the audience, the final outcome of this adventure is quite unpredictable. Hence, the entire project can also be seen as a social experiment.\nWhatever the outcome, depending on the success of this project, I intend to hire an animation studio to create an animated movie from the final storyline. I think it would be a great gift to all the people who engaged with the project if they could watch an animated version of their story on Netflix someday, powered by the Optimism&#8217;s Superchain approach.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ISTLR.png,671,767,901262,1of1s,"Stability AI,Zora",https://zora.co/collect/base:0x8bb685e083dcbd220b5ab2843f5577bf01ee9c62

The colors are a little dusky, which are called traditional Japanese colors, giving the cat a chic atmosphere with a touch of cuteness. I used AI software called NFPrompt for the production. This is the first piece I created using AI. I put in some spells to make it, but it was difficult to make it different from hand-drawing. I had to redo it nearly 100 times until I arrived at what I imagined. Thanks to that, I was able to create a cat that was even better than I had imagined.\nhttps://nfprompt.io/\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/All-round-cat.png,1714,1844,1735093,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/op/0x3e17e0C05A7c1985Aff7431a21a5216702193487
12390,Temptation,"Concept:\nTemptation is inspired by the current discussions surrounding artificial intelligence. We stand on the precipice of great change in society with the introduction of these tools which will change our lives. They have already increased the abilities of those who use them in a way that is simply amazing. But there are also dangers as well. With increased productivity, and decreased demand on skills which can be replaced by AI, and an ever accelerating arms race as tools are developed unregulated, there are inherent dangers involved.\nMy idea for the visual components of this piece were to use the allegory of original sin, to talk about this moment with AI, as she even just gets a taste of the apple, it begins to unlock her potential and change her, the technology within brings enlightenment, but the snakes coiling around her arm represent the dangers. She can see the rearing snake and knows that danger it presents, she might get bitten. But she does not see the second snake, hidden beneath the apple, there are unforeseen issues with AI which could take us by surprise. We won&#8217;t really know until we see it. \nPROCESS\nI created the base image in Dalle 3. The prompting process was fairly simple. Laying out the elements and then tweaking the prompt until producing the desired result. \n&#8220;Please create an image with the biblical eve holding an apple, with a circuit board and chip inside, the apple has a bite taken from it, and two snakes coil around her arms. The image should be presented in a painterly style with a chiaroscurro aesthetic, that is similar to dutch master paintings. The lighting should be dramatic in a way that evokes chiaroscurro lighting. Glitch aesthetic circuit overlays&#8221;\nfrom there I began to prompt and re-prompt until achieving the right aesthetic and placement of the elements.\nThe output image was square, although Dalle can produce long or wide variants, I don&#8217;t really like the way it handles composition for those styles and it&#8217;s fairly unpredictable when asking for this. So I took my output to Photoshop and used generative fill to produce an expanded 2:3 ratio. I then used patch tool, and healing tool to clean up some of the join line edges and then took the image to Topaz Gigapixel. This is an AI upscaler, that is used for adding resolution to an image with AI. \nI output the file at 2000px on the long edge, to keep it at a workable size to then run through MAGNIFIC.AI ( https://magnific.ai/editor/ ) I ran this through Magnific three times at first, to create three different variations with the creativity and resemblance sliders tweaked, and then brought these three images back into photoshop and used a masking tool to mask the elements that I liked in and the elements i did not like out. \nThe resulting image was very close to what I wanted. I then downscaled the image again, and separated it into quarters, and then Magnific upscaled each quarter by 2x and then used photoshop to stitch these quarters back into the complete image.\nBecause Magnific has an overall pixel limtation of around 4000 square, it was important to use this quadrant grid upscaling to get the final image up to 11000 px on the long edge. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/NuclearSamurai-Temptation-submission.jpg,8000,6000,5191342,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xb018fe786a3cc36022171d71d7478a4dbaaf826a/2

12335,The Journey to Optimism,"Why did I create this track?\nI see both music and crypto as cultural cornerstones. Just as art is celebrated in various competitions, I believe music should similarly elevate crypto culture. \nTo honor this, I created a piece as a tribute to Optimism and its founder, Jinglan Wang, weaving a narrative using samples from an a16z Crypto startup school conversation.\nThe song is structured like a cycle, where the beginning holds a clue to the end. Jinglan&#8217;s phrase &#8220;that&#8217;s how it started&#8221; is echoed at both the start and end of the track, creating a seamless loop that encapsulates the journey.\nWhy a chillout vibe?\nJinglan&#8217;s relaxed demeanor in the conversation video inspired me. Her comfortable posture, humor, and laid-back attitude were key influences.\nWhy Lo-fi?\nI chose the lo-fi genre to mirror the conceptual synergy between crypto culture and this music style: both offer escapism ‚Äî crypto to a decentralized utopia and lo-fi to a tranquil, introspective realm. They share a raw, unpolished quality, embodying a new world where novelty and authenticity trump perfection. Both are also inherently anti-establishment, challenging conventional norms and structures.\nAs for the track length of 4:20, well, some things are better left unsaid. üòâ\nProcess and tools:\nIdeation: I began by contemplating what story I wanted to share, eventually deciding to narrate about Optimism through music.\nResearch and Sampling: I sourced audio from various calls and videos, including an a16z Crypto talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WlciSNGwg).\nI focused on balancing informativeness with a light, engaging tone.\nCreation: Using Ableton Live 10 for composition (except mastering), I combined self-created and collected samples. \nThe process was straightforward, with a vinyl sound added for a nostalgic touch. Mastering was done using BandLab&#8217;s free online tool (https://www.bandlab.com).\nCover Art: For the track&#8217;s cover image, created with Dall-E 3, I aimed to capture the essence of &#8220;the journey to optimism,&#8221; incorporating symbolic elements like a road, Ethereum, the red sun representing the Optimism logo, and vibrant colors.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG-20240108-WA0011.jpg,1401,1401,255323,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xa4a0f16f406d48ceddd1687bdf218d1b4d825d39/1

However, when I was tasked with converting this artwork onto the blockchain, I felt like the traditional method of pre fabricating artwork off chain, and selling it to users at high prices, wasn&#8217;t the way to go. I wanted to contribute something new to the traditional NFT space, by uploading all of individual layers onto arweave or IPFS, and using on chain data to generate the traits that would ultimately result in the final NFT. Users could theoretically reverse engineer the NFT using on chain data and combining the layers themselves.\nCurrently, the project is written in pure javascript / html, and the code can be found here: https://github.com/basedaliens/basedaliensociety\nI&#8217;ve added a few small flairs to the NFT, considering it&#8217;s an HTML page.

The dimly lit blue and pink lights in my studio set the mood as I begin working on the song. I start by crafting a dark and grimy bass synth with Serum in Ableton. Once I have dialed in to the right sound I begin playing the bass line on my Akai MPK 49 keyboard. The bass is one of the most important elements in my songs. I am also wearing a Subpac, which is basically a subwoofer built into a backpack. It immerses my body in low frequencies allowing me to feel a physical dimension to the sound. The bass is heavy yet refined.\nI continue adding more elements to the song until I get to my favorite part, recording the guitar. I strum some big power chords on my Custom Gibson &#8217;69 Les Paul and it electrifies the track. It perfectly captures the cyberpunk vibe: dark electro basslines, banger guitar chords, and trap elements. \nI feel invincible as I blare the finished track in my car, speeding through the LA streets at 3 am, blowing smoke out the window&#8230; Free.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Free-Bird-cover-art.png,1486,1486,100773,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/harrowyn/free-bird

However, the longer the viewer enjoys this colorful picture, the more he realizes that the bear is not so simple. Suddenly, in the magic of purple-orange hues, a second bear appears, like the shadow of his cheerful incarnation. Two bears existing in one form create an amazing illusion of duality and inner harmony.

12253,Innocence,"Tools and Tech: iPad and Procreate\nMy process in design: Storytelling and Creating a character bio\nMeet Yurei, the protagonist of my creation, heavily influenced by &#8220;The Spirit&#8221; in the White Rabbit Anime Web3 series.\nAs the story goes, born Abe Yuri, the only child to a noble family in Old Japan during the Edo period, her life took a mystical turn when she fell ill as a child. Rescued by a medicine woman, the cure altered her appearance ‚Äì her once raven-black hair turned icy blue.\nThe illustration of Yurei beautifully captures her essence as a young, innocent girl who overcame a challenging illness. Despite her fragile appearance, her spirit radiates kindness and sweetness, reflecting the resilience that helped her triumph over adversity. Her parents, portrayed as deeply protective, surround her with an aura of familial love and care. This portrayal not only emphasizes Yurei&#8217;s growth but also adds a poignant touch to her character, embodying the delicate balance between vulnerability and strength within the protective embrace of her family.\nI opted for a portrait-style painting, utilizing the Max Pack along with custom brushes tailored for the Procreate app. These tools allowed me to achieve nuanced strokes and specific effects, contributing to the creation of my digital artwork.

12249,Observing the Last Four Days,"Observing The Last Four Days takes its title from the closing words of Aratus&#8217; Phaenomena. The poet instructed that in order to reach a sure understanding of the skies and constellations, the reader should observe the last four days of the old month and the first four days of the new.\nThis is a very personal work for me, it observes the storytelling ages of a dear loved one. The beloved figure in the painting does not noticeably age at all, instead the passing of time is depicted through a surreal use of objects. The description for the artwork reads as follows:\n&#8220;a blanket and a small light through, a book of star sizes, everything else in a box, and a close eye.&#8221;\nThe art and its description hope to draw the visitor near to the subject of childhood imagination, and the loving, parental, artistic observation of that imagination changing over time. The table, once covered in a blanket and used for a reading den, now floats bare. The figure, once fascinated by enormity and unfathomable myth, is shown thinking only of an unknown human face, expressing the changes made to the kind of magnificence that interests them, from myth to mortal Phaenomena. The figure is shown as a kind of star. Fascinating and phenomenal, being observed over time, that the observer might know them more.\nI created this work using Procreate paintbrushes, then creating a low opacity layer in Photoshop to give a page-like quality.\nI returned here to a style of art making that I have used previously to create fable works, as mentioned briefly in my artist bio. It is a style that brings me such immense joy, it touches on the surreal beauty in storytelling and how that surreal beauty can express the deeply personal experience of living and loving.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fourdays-scaled.jpg,2560,1814,441023,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x32eaad4f0d71e76ab4d604d8b85bf631854310eb/1

12241,Chronosynthesis: The Tapestry of Time,"In creating &#8220;Digital Renaissance,&#8221; a fusion of Renaissance artistry and futuristic vision, the process was multifaceted yet concise. It began with an in-depth study of both historical and futuristic aesthetics, followed by digital sketches to layout the intricate composition of fresco-adorned skyscrapers and diverse characters. The artwork was then brought to life using advanced digital tools, focusing on a unique color palette that blended the deep, moody hues of the Renaissance with the vibrant neon of a futuristic world.

The reality can be a lot more complicated when its your own emotions involved.\nThis song is from a collection of three that I created in 2023 while living in Colombia. I was torn on submitting Comatose, a sexed up love song, or this one, a song about a complicated break up that had to happen but was incredibly difficult to do all the same. Ultimately I chose this one because I think it is the &#8220;minor key&#8221; emotions that move us more. Also I think this one is catchier.\nI hope you can appreciate the bilingual expression in this song and hear both sides of the conflicting emotions at play. While the lyrics are short and straightforward they summarily capture the emotions of the moment and the energetic 90&#8217;s eurorave inspired instrumentation on the reggaeton beat transform an intense frustration bordering on red hot hatred into an impassioned cry for something better &#8211; a love that is real &#8211; and to burn away the worthless refuse of the past.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cover-2.png,1024,1024,1686951,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x2a45b26c0e5232fd06c43496f7f48c0a7fe117ed/3?referrer=0xDC4471ee9DFcA619Ac5465FdE7CF2634253a9dc6

The story&#8217;s rich tapestry, blending technological advancements with human emotion and conflict, serves as the foundation for my auditory creation. The goal is to produce a beat that not only complements the story but also resonates with the themes of innovation, danger, and the complex interplay between technology and human nature.\nProcess and Creation:\nStory Analysis: The first step involved a thorough analysis of &#8220;&#8221;Duet Attack.&#8221;&#8221; Key themes, such as the rise of decentralized networks, the tumultuous journey of Zara, and the underlying tone of tension and breakthroughs in blockchain technology, were identified to drive the musical direction.\nMood Setting: To echo the story&#8217;s ambiance, I decided to blend electronic and ambient sounds, capturing the futuristic and sometimes chaotic world of Web 3.0. The beats fluctuate to reflect Zara&#8217;s journey &#8211; from the optimism of the new digital age to the suspense and danger of her encounters.\nBeat Composition: Utilizing digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Ableton Live and FL Studio, I created a base layer of beats. These DAWs are ideal for blending a variety of sounds and effects, crucial for achieving the desired depth and complexity. Ableton Live can be explored here, and FL Studio here.\nSound Layering: To mirror the layered complexity of blockchain technology, various sound layers were added. I incorporated synthesized sounds to represent the digital aspect, and organic sounds like distant echoes and subtle rhythms to add a human touch. This contrast mirrors the human-machine relationship central to the story.\nFinal Touches: The last phase involved refining the beats, adjusting the tempo, and ensuring a seamless flow. I wanted the final product to be a journey in itself, starting with a slower, more introspective rhythm that gradually builds into a more complex and intense sound, reflecting the climax of Zara&#8217;s story.\nTools Used:\nDigital Audio Workstations (DAWs): Ableton Live and FL Studio were primary tools for beat creation and sound mixing.\nSound Libraries and Synthesizers: VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins for these DAWs, like Serum and Omnisphere, provided a wide range of sounds.

12175,Es Mi Party,"This is my first album that I&#8217;ve created since moving to Medell√≠n, Colombia. When I visited here October 2022 I fell in love with a city that felt free and inviting and a wonderful culture that&#8217;s impossible to forget. I&#8217;ve been told by many people back in the US that I should forget about this and go back to being a &#8220;normal person&#8221; but quite frankly I think they can keep their opinions to themselves.\nThere is some kind of magic in South America, perhaps in the jungles or the air or the people themselves that I just haven&#8217;t been able to feel anywhere else. I&#8217;ve been around the world and there&#8217;s simply nothing quite like it.\nIt took a couple months living in Colombia to feel the music within start to bubble up but once I did there was no going back, I simply had to create something. \nI originally created this track last summer for a girl I was seeing at the time but she didn&#8217;t care for it so I turned it into my own song with the intent to capture a fun sort of energetic vibe that I like.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cover-1.png,1024,1024,1686951,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x2a45b26c0e5232fd06c43496f7f48c0a7fe117ed/2?referrer=0xDC4471ee9DFcA619Ac5465FdE7CF2634253a9dc6

12157,LIFEPATH,"Concept Development: The initial stage involved brainstorming and sketching ideas. The aim was to symbolize the entire human lifespan in a cohesive, yet visually engaging manner. I decided to use a path as a metaphor for life&#8217;s journey, beginning with birth and concluding with death. Each life stage along the path was to be characterized by distinctive elements that resonate with that particular phase.\nArtistic Tools: For the digital creation, I utilized advanced AI-based graphic design software. This software enabled the blending of vivid colors and dreamlike elements seamlessly, essential for achieving the surreal effect.\nDesign Process:\nBirth: The artwork begins with a sunrise, symbolizing birth. The sunrise is bright and glowing, filled with hope and potential.\nChildhood: The path then meanders through scenes of childhood, depicted with playful imagery and vibrant colors, capturing the innocence and wonder of early years.\nAdolescence and Youth: As the path progresses, it depicts the vibrancy and energy of youth through dynamic scenes, reflecting the exploration and discovery characteristic of these years.\nAdulthood: In adulthood, the path takes on a more serene tone, illustrating adult responsibilities and achievements with a sense of calm and fulfillment.\nOld Age: The journey culminates in old age, portrayed through peaceful and tranquil scenes, leading to a sunset that symbolizes the end of life.\nSurreal Elements: Throughout the artwork, surreal elements were integrated to blur the lines between the real and the imaginary, encouraging viewers to interpret life‚Äôs journey through a lens of wonder and imagination.\nColor Palette and Style: I chose a vivid and varied color palette to differentiate between life stages while maintaining a harmonious overall look. The style melds realistic landscapes with fantastical elements, creating a dreamlike quality that invites introspection.\nFinal Touches: The final stage involved refining details and ensuring a smooth transition between the different life phases. The goal was to create a sense of fluidity, where each stage flows naturally into the next, much like the journey of life itself.\nThis artwork was a fusion of imaginative concept, digital artistry, and a thoughtful portrayal of the human experience, designed to evoke emotions and provoke thought about the journey we all undertake from birth to death.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LifePath.png,1024,1024,2216472,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x08a6c554813e5d0a722fd4648e53cff87c74b47a/1

12145,Woulda Been You,"I wrote &#8220;Woulda Been You&#8221; with my fianc√© in our little one bedroom apartment in Silver Lake, CA on a random summer evening. He picked up an acoustic guitar, I spat out some quick melodies, and we laughed our asses off at every line we came up with. Over the next few days we produced the track together, and quickly gave birth to our very first song-child. \n&#8220;Would Been You&#8221; chronicles my previous, and obviously failed, attempts at love. After meeting my fianc√©/producer, Tanner Orange, it became so apparent to me that none of those relationships were meant to be, because they just weren&#8217;t him. The chorus lyrics state that he could&#8217;ve been &#8220;just a dude&#8221;, a &#8220;leather coat with attitude&#8221;, or even &#8220;trippin&#8217; balls and high on shrooms&#8221;, but that no matter what he did, it would&#8217;ve been him. \nThis was a very collaborative process that took place over the course of about two weeks. Both Tanner and I took turns recording voice memos, jotting down lyric ideas, trying out fun chord progressions, and recording absurd sounds in the computer. A few of the tools we used to create this work include 2 DAWS: Logic Pro X and Pro Tools, a few different microphones: the Neumann TLM-103 for acoustic guitar, the Blue Dragonfly for lead vocals, and a Shure SM7 for backing vocals/harmonies, and many more. Samples From Mars came in handy with their soft-drum machines, although I can&#8217;t recall which specific one we used. Probably an MPC of some sort. Tanner tracked bass on my brother&#8217;s Squier with flat wound strings DI&#8217;d into an Apollo Twin MKII, and beefed up with Nembrini Audio&#8217;s PSA1000 pre-amp. The acoustic we used on this song was a 1974 Alvarez, and the electrics were a 1981 Gibson SG and a 2010 American Fender Stratocaster. The Gibson was tracked through a VOX AC30 with Celestion Alnico blue speakers (2&#215;12), and the Strat was DI&#8217;d through the Apollo using Neural DSP plug-ins (probably the Morgan Amps Suite). Lastly, we used Spectrasonics Omnisphere for all the quirky sounds/keys, and a variety of percussion to fill out the production. Kyle De Loera (DYSN) mixed the song, and Chris Gehringer (Sterling Sound) mastered it. \nThe image that we used for the artwork is a photograph of Tanner and I reuniting after a 5 week long tour. It was taken in the upstairs green room of The Roxy in Hollywood, CA. We then processed it through an AI-generator with keywords &#8220;shrooms, leather, and honeymoon&#8221; (all lyrics in the song). What we got back is the perfect representation of of how we feel falling more and more in love with each other every day. It&#8217;s basically like a shroom trip that feels very euphoric and mushy-gushy, but without the psychedelics. Shoutout Juan Flores Mena (Instagram: @sk8orjuan) for the image. \nWe hope you enjoy! \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Woulda-Been-You-Nhala-ARTWORK.png,864,864,986441,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/nhala/woulda-been-you?referral_source=link

12113,Touch Me &#8211; The Full Timeline of Digital Love,"A visual musical of the emotional journey we go through when establishing a deep connection with someone starting from the digital realm, based on Tiehan&#8217;s single &#8216;Touch Me&#8217;.\nFrom Numi, the visual artist:\n&#8220;The visuals that accompanying Tiehan&#8217;s single ‚ÄòTouch Me‚Äô were entirely inspired by our conversations about his inspiration for the sonics and lyrics. \nAs ‚Äòthird culture kids‚Äô, we‚Äôve both experienced relationships across borders &#8211; even continents, and the agony this brings at times. \nUsing my background of architecture, we considered the possibility of creating three-dimensional space within the confines of digital screens, as if we could truly communicate with loved ones on our devices as if they could physically be in contact with us. \nThe concept for the point-cloud visualization was sparked by the thought experiment in quantum physics called ‚ÄòSchrodinger‚Äôs Cat‚Äô, where a physical object may not exist until you pay attention to it. Without paying full attention to the visuals of Touch Me, you may not be entirely sure you are actually looking at anything at all. If we didn‚Äôt have the technology to see the faces of our loved ones halfway across the world, we may forget their likeness entirely. \nThe concepts of NFTs resonate similarly to the individual points that resemble Tiehan in this visualizer. As digital products, you are able to extend the likeness of something that was conjured from physical things. As an NFT, it‚Äôs as if we broke the fourth wall to bring this piece of art into a space beyond the digital. \nIn a way, we have immortalized his emotional performance beyond the electronic production of the track, and created a new dimension entirely.&#8221;\nFrom Tiehan, the music artist:\n&#8220;This piece is a reflection of the a deep relationship that I had with some one started in the digital realm.\nIn the digital world, we&#8217;ve formed connections from all corners of the world through the World Wide Web, much like an invisible red thread tightly binding us together, which the Chinese call &#8216;Yuanfen&#8217;.

12023,Seed Phrase,"The concept for this art piece revolves around the fusion of the tangible and the intangible. It&#8217;s about exploring the intersection of human identity and the evolving landscape of digital identity. The randomly generated swirls form different types of common fingerprints (https://www.forensicsciencesimplified.org/prints/principles.html). These fingerprints can be most commonly seen in a loop or s shape. As you generate new art you&#8217;ll notice how loops or the letter S is a common image. It serves as a bridge between the organic and the cryptographic, symbolizing the connection between individuality and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency. \nI decided to go with fingerprints because of how easy it is for someone to understand what they are. They are used as a form of identification and can be found on official government documents. There are no 2 fingerprints that are alike. A fingerprint is much like a seed phrase. They are unique to you and help you access important materials. Cryptocurrency is a new thing, and can be hard to understand that&#8217;s why its important to find common alternatives when trying to get others to understand what something is capable of.\nThe concept of the art digs into the idea that within the unique patterns of our fingerprints lies the potential for a new kind of security, a seed phrase that unlocks the doors to the digital economy. By incorporating the randomness of the seed phrase, the artwork emphasizes the unpredictability and complexity of cryptographic systems, showcasing the intricate patterns found in the natural world.\nNot only that but each particle is randomly colored from a color bank of 80 different colors. At first I was only planning on using 12 colors to represent a common seed phrase size, but considering that we are in a new year and what better represents the new year than fireworks I decided to go with a firework style fingerprint. When you generate a new piece the strokes are enclosed in a circle similar to the shape of a firework. The different colors help showcase the uniqueness in each fingerprint.\nThe tools I used were the p5.js found on https://editor.p5js.org/ and Visual Studio Code.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seedphrase.png,1526,1680,1149695,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659b9c0f66d1a3855c932c4e

11990,Optimistic Delight,"My concept is ‚ÄúCake Art.‚Äù I know, cake may sound like a craft that is not that difficult or requires labor. But it&#8217;s not like that! I spent three days making this cake that I designed for Optimism. I kept the concept ‚Äúelegant‚Äù. If I start with the ingredients, I used 6 layers of cake base. In addition, for a smooth, delicious and matte cream, called &#8220;buttercream&#8221; in pastry, I used 200 mL cream, 400g white chocolate, 150g butter and red food coloring. I used whipped cream and strawberry jam for the inside of the cake. After preparing each layer, I kept both the cake and the buttercream in the refrigerator overnight to rest. The next day was the day to cover the cake properly and design Optimism&#8217;s &#8220;OP&#8221; letters and cover them with sugarpaste. For an elegant and memorable look, it was very important that my cream was bubble-free and matte, and I achieved this! After 3 smooth layers, I left my cake to rest in the fridge and started making my letters. After creating the measurements for the cake, I cut out the patterns I drew on the cardboard. I rolled out my sugar paste and covered the top of the mold to create a delicious look. After assembling my ready-made cake and the letters, I completed my cake by squeezing the white cream I had previously reserved under the letters with a squeeze bag as the final touch. What a job. On the third day, with the help of my brother, we literally turned our living room into a photography studio! By playing with the lights and background, I finally achieved the look I wanted. Meanwhile, we used my sister&#8217;s professional Canon camera. I would also like to thank my brother and sister for their efforts, it was a very nice experience for me. I hope I have been able to produce a product that the Optimism juries will¬†like¬†as¬†well.üíñ \nCollection Link:\nhttps://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x9634413f0f9e77a6228cf801e7e7dfe452d91e5b\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OptimisticDelight-scaled.jpg,2560,1707,427400,1of1s,Zora,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x5d727afca0da1b8404a5ae23648f567a20035052/2

In the traditional music industry, the small amount you make from streaming paired with the countless middle men makes it nearly impossible to earn a living, which is why most people resort to the philosophy of ‚Äúget as many plays as possible at all costs‚Äù\nThis is really unfortunate because the thing that takes a hit is authenticity, experimentation, and novelty. Music has become extremely watered down and we see this as the promise of releasing music onchain.\nThrough onchain music we‚Äôve been able to connect with fans directly, making a win win scenario for both fans and artists. We get to make weirder music, and fans are more connected to the artists they love. We really believe these small vibrant niches are the way to keep music new and fresh, and allow more artists to make a living doing what they love.\nCitadel is our sign-off as we embark on a multi-month journey to embark on the creation of Season Two and scaling our brand from a purely onchain audience to a globally recognized brand that can bring these intentions to the rest of the world.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Citadel-Cover-Art.jpg,8448,8448,9870508,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/rohki/citadel-rohki-theme

Without paying full attention to the visuals of Touch Me, you may not be entirely sure you are actually looking at anything at all. If we didn‚Äôt have the technology to see the faces of our loved ones halfway across the world, we may forget their likeness entirely. \nThe concepts of NFTs resonate similarly to the individual points that resemble Tiehan in this visualizer. As digital products, you are able to extend the likeness of something that was conjured from physical things. As an NFT, it‚Äôs as if we broke the fourth wall to bring this piece of art into a space beyond the digital. \nIn a way, we have immortalized his emotional performance beyond the electronic production of the track, and created a new dimension entirely.&#8221;\n&#8212; Numi\nVisual Artist, Multidisciplinary Creative, Producer\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-13.54.10.jpeg,1080,1080,342837,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xed2ba3842c9c1d1d5938a36c1bba7dd4c17f25d7

This short film illustrates the challenges of and the vulnerability that comes with putting your art online for the world to consume and critique. It‚Äôs the internet ‚Äî everyone has opinions and it‚Äôs too easy to fall into the trap of trying to please everyone. For me, this film is a reminder to be true to myself as an artist and make what genuinely excites me, never mind the comment section or the algorithm.\nThe Process:\nI wrote the script, storyboarded the scenes and shot them around various locations near my home in Philadelphia. I then produced the track and laid down the voice-over using FL Studio and some samples from Splice. I wanted the track to feel like an immersive experience, even without the visuals, so I mastered it using an intelligent automatic equalizer plugin called Gullfoss by Soundtheory. In Premiere, I laid down my footage on top of the audio track and began editing. I used making to achieve the cloning effect.

11883,Future coordinated between technology and nature based on Japanese garden,"In Japan, gardens are designed to harmonize man-made artifacts with nature. This stems from the unique Japanese concept of &#8220;Yaoyorozu no Kami,&#8221; which posits that any and everything can be an object of reverence. Based on this philosophy, artificial objects and nature are not seen as conflicting, but rather as existing equally and desirably coexisting.\nCurrently, with the rapid advancement of technology, particularly AI, there&#8217;s a growing concern that technology, surpassing human intelligence, might eventually dominate humanity. This pessimism is rooted in the Western perspective of viewing technology merely as a tool for human use.

And well, the possibility of flying, for instance, in the physical world is perhaps much more discreet. Starting from the ability to take your feet off the ground in everyday life is unsatisfactory. This series ‚ÄúThe Anti-gravity Chronicles‚Äù with some irony, seeks to contrast the great virtual power of the human being and the limited but poetic physical reality when the body takes off from the ground.\nI took pictures from people who work on billboard installation and created collages as references to then, decompound the urban images into the purity of the color language in acrylic painting and color pencil drawing.

11840,"ARCHIVIST, BROKEN","ARCHIVIST, BROKEN\nIs adapted from ARCHIVIST, an individual work from an unreleased series which was intended to be submitted into David Rudnick‚Äôs Tomb Series via the Recovery system (described here: https://t.co/dMh7I8DkHt)\nThe unreleased series is titled ‚Äú20 Evocations‚Äù after Bruce Sterling‚Äôs 1984 experimental short story ‚ÄúTwenty Evocations‚Äù, and is itself a kind of visual bootleg fan fiction, an alternate take on the concept of the Tomb Series. \nüìñ\nSterling‚Äôs short story is written as sequence of twenty very brief sections, each no more than a paragraph or two, momentary flashes of experience spread across the protagonist‚Äôs life, each seemingly disconnected, but together building to a sense of a whole, an imprint of identity, memory ‚Äî a hyper-compressed literary technology which acts as a way to experience this life on fast forward, and as an elegy as it ends at the conclusion of the text. \nüíΩ\nDavid Rudnick‚Äôs Tomb Series is 177 illustrations of MiniDiscs, which each bear, though their visual variations, symbols, and titling and grouping into thematically connected houses, a token of Rudnick‚Äôs formative experiences, influences, and convictions. Rudnick has spoken about the desire to create works which act as vessels to cary forward those immaterial and sublime things to the future. \nüíæ\n20 Evocations, is like the Tomb Series made up of illustrations of obsolete hardware storage. Rather than MiniDiscs, this series depicts 5.2‚Äù magneto optical disks, an older family of formats chiefly used for archiving files in the days before abundant external hard drives. They are illustrated in 2D, in this case using vector drawings, gradients, simple effects, and some procedurally generated textures. (Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, and Blender&#8217;s node based texturing system specifically) The series was originally conceived before Recovery was even announced, intended to be distributed in the active (at the time) Tomb Series Discord server. Like the mother series, each of the 20 Evocations illustrations would reflect, explicitly or poetically, formative personal influences, deeply held values, fragments of thought evoking an unseen whole of the artists life. \nWhen Recovery was announced, with its goal of creating a community governed platform of ‚Äúculture building culture‚Äù, it lined up perfectly. ARCHIVIST, a disc which bore the emblem of the Tomb Council, was intended to celebrate this.\nHowever, Recovery‚Äôs exciting and active beta launched just before a dramatic shift in the on-chain art landscape, the downstream cultural impacts of the colapse of various web3 organizations collapsing, leading to a dampening of activity and interest, and creating economic barriers to minting new work. When Recovery‚Äôs front end stopped functioning, the project and community seemed to go into a kind of hibernation.\nARCHIVIST, BROKEN as a piece of art is intended to express this moment ‚Äî¬†a storage device for the meaning condensed around the Tomb Series, damaged, functioning partially, producing artifacts when read and accessed, but, hopefully, still recoverable. \nIt is set to mint for free, as has become expected in this post &#8211; peak NFT moment, an edition of 177 to reflect the number of original Tombs. \nThe team behind Tomb Series has expressed the intention to bring Recovery back online, at which time the full series of 20 Evocations will hopefully be proposed and released. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ARCHIVIST-BROKEN-small.png,1107,1000,1328876,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xb7a0b4eba2098f0ef54a1a52cace78acd5647eeb/1

Attaching some photos of the piece itself.\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/EtjVHAYVCjbD4c6a9\nThis was first sketched onto a very large canvas with pencil. I tried to incorporate nautilus and used both several rulers and a compass to help me with the straight and rounded edges. I then proceeded to draw the dark black lines and then taped out the red areas. \nI used multiple coats of base red before starting to add in a darker red. I then worked with both of these to create forms of shading. After this I redid the black. The black was done using an acrylic marker. After finishing the black and red, I proceeded to work on the whites and a variety of the textures. I tended to work in layers so for the scales I worked using the technique paint glaze to create depth, texture, and transparency.\nAll colors were made from these three and the white and gray (made from the black and white) were the last layers, working in parallel. Finally, I went back and touched up all the layers. My hand isn&#8217;t the steadiest, but I think some of the imperfections of the lines is what distinguishes the art and gives it a unique feeling.\nAfter finishing the painting I had someone frame it on wood where it currently hangs at home. Being a coder this was a super fun process and I learned so many new techniques watching youtube videos and working with partner who has a masters in contemporary painting. It took me a couple weeks, but I am very pleased with the outcome.\n____\nThe piece itself has it&#8217;s whole description on zora which is pasted here:\nThis piece uses a nautilus, repetition, and trichotomy (red, white, and black acrylic paints). The red and white are symbolic of Optimisms core colors.\nThe concept is of both optimistic rollups and scale. The concept of scale works in a abstract and literal sense using actual fish within the painting. These fish are different shapes and sizes, but all are then combined into one larger circle representing the concept of rollups (multiple fish which can be viewed as the transactions being compiled into one single circle/ transaction), which is then seen as the overall focal point of the canvas and passed the easiest to the eye.\nThe shading is intended to draw you into certain areas of the canvas and the tiny dots are also a representation of the scales on a fish.\nThis organic but repetitive pattern is intended to make you think deeply about the concept of the OP chain and the future of the Superchain and their possibilities. The eyes of the fish are the most prominent as we will all be watching to see how this develops, and the vertical lines are intended to cause disruption and rhythm, much like how the blockchain works, generally functioning very proficiently, but then experiencing major ebs and flows in transaction costs/ gas prices due to usage.\n____\nOverall my start was with the idea of rollups, scaling and based off the idea of scales in fish. It was a lot of brainstorming and I wanted to create something abstract that also demonstrated a lot of concept I see in OP.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anothermain.png,999,1002,1880696,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x15108bd96d133adfd086af9e8ca061f13819886b/1

11803,Skatrans,"The skateboarding community has evolved over the years, and today we can see some queer people in the sport.\nAs usual in my work, there is representation, which I believe is important for the skateboarding and LGBTQIAP+ communities. \nThis piece was motivated by a post of mine on X skating (https://x.com/qabqabqab/status/1740009465498493333?s=20), in which I was part of a thread of travestis/trans women skateboarders. There has been and still is oppression of trans bodies practicing the sport in some spaces, but we still continue to practice it because of the love we have for it.\nThis thread and the number of people who were reached shocked me and made me realize how important it is to represent LGBTQIAP+ people in skateboarding, where it is rarely seen, but there are a good number of people in this scene.\n&#8220;Kien Caples&#8221; was the person I chose as the filming reference for the animation&#8217;s rotoscoping.

11792,How it Started vs. How it&#8217;s Going,"I created this collage as part of my Starter Pack collection on Zora, which is made up of cultural artifacts from my artist journey. \nIn 2017, shortly after I moved from DC to Miami, I had a powerful awakening &amp; transformation. I was doing a lot of inner work after a bad breakup, going to meditations, sound healings, ceremonies, etc. I decided to dive in &amp; peel back all of the layers of myself. I uncovered some childhood traumas &amp; a lot of limiting beliefs that I started healing &amp; breaking through. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not creative‚Äù was one of them!\n‚Äúùêà‚Äôùê¶ ùêßùê®ùê≠ ùêúùê´ùêûùêöùê≠ùê¢ùêØùêû,‚Äù I thought. This is what I told myself my whole life, holding myself back. Holding myself small. Ever since I overheard a teacher say it to my Mom when I was a little girl in school. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not creative,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs more analytical‚Ä¶‚Äù\nSo my whole life, I was singing other people‚Äôs songs, because I thought I couldn‚Äôt create my own. Until my spiritual awakening &amp; transformation in 2017, when this exact memory surfaced in a meditation &amp; I realized that ùêà ùêöùê¶ ùêúùê´ùêûùêöùê≠ùê¢ùêØùêû! We are all creative &amp; we are here on this planet to create!!! \nFrom that moment on, my whole life changed!

She came to America to make a better life for us &amp; left me with my Grandparents for about 2 years while she got situated in NYC. You can see the pain in my eyes‚ÄîHow much I missed her &amp; longed for her. I was singing about how beautiful she is &amp; how much I love her.\nThe second video is from my performance with my music duo, KarmaVioletta, at the Underground Violet Rave at Art Basel!

In these images, I delve into the concept of &#8216;variants&#8217; of myself, using them as a cornerstone in creating the Knight&#8217;s story. This narrative, set in a realm where fears whisper through the winds and night, is both a teacher and a crucible, and it mirrors a significant life transition I experienced. The Knight&#8217;s journey, a transformative quest forged in the heart of darkness, reflects my introspections and struggles. By intertwining my inner battles and fears with the Knight&#8217;s Odyssey, the story unfolds as a relatable tapestry of overcoming and enlightenment. \nThis artistic journey aims to convey a universal message of resilience and hope, illustrating how there is always the promise of a new dawn, even in the depths of despair.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/angeldarmella_httpss.mj_.runDzdNFkrCAIA_httpss.mj_.runvJMA1OIhC_6d59530d-2536-41a8-9924-37b27a421713_3.png,1024,1024,944518,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x9ab96777afae3c7c2d2eab5dea786e4429cbfe3e?personalize=false

11779,The No Painting,"For me, the artistic process must be analog, as old school as Peter Paul Rubens. When I talk about using an image as a reference, I mean it quite literally. I&#8217;ve taken inspiration from &#8220;The Hunt&#8221; by Peter Paul Rubens for more than 50 paintings. Sometimes the entire artwork serves as my reference, and at other times, it might be just a small piece or even just the tiger, etc. At this point, I know this piece by heart, and I use its lines, forms, and figures as a guide for my creations, or as I like to call it, my &#8220;interpretations.&#8221;\nMy works are a reflection of the level of abstraction I&#8217;m experiencing at the moment, where abstraction refers to the reduction of uncertainties. To achieve this, I often turn to Procreate to trace any line or form that catches my eye. Once I&#8217;ve captured the essence, I can then decide on the color palette. After this digital exploration, I transition to the real world, where my preferred medium is oil, although I also appreciate the versatility of mixed media.

11764,Theater of Life,"(image uploaded in the form isn&#8217;t at full quality because of the MB limit)\nThis meticulously crafted masterpiece unfolds with a rich palette of earthy tones, fragmented by impetuous brushstrokes that shape solid contours and skewed perspectives. Through spontaneous diagonal splashes of the palette knife, the composition simulates roofs, shelters, and houses, generating a vivid sense of movement.\nThe visual narrative begins with a central standard holding the imposing Sun, represented by a spiral symbolizing evolution. This Sun, positioned at the highest point of the city, stands as the shared aspiration of all fundamental actors in society, visible from every perspective.\nTo the right of the Sun, the representation of religion unfolds, embodied by the church, marriage, and family. These elements suggest doctrinal connections leading to the pursuit of the Self. The market, a labyrinth filled with aromas and flavors, represents a place where everyone seeks sustenance, regardless of their social status.\nJust below the Sun, a dynamic scene encompasses those who meditate under the light, sow fruits, support others, build, repair, travel, stroll, or exercise. The central square becomes a space of coexistence where people from various social strata share the same environment, from ladies walking their dogs in elegant dresses to the more modest inhabitants.\nTo the left of the Sun, spirituality manifests through the arts, literature, and poetry. At the zenith, figures like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza bravely confront the dragon-windmill. Amidst flashes of light, the Liz flower, a symbol of divinity, love, power, and wisdom, radiates inspiration for this artwork.\nThe concert hall, a stage for harmonized dances with the philharmonic, creates a unique connection among individuals, all illuminated by a shared light. Behind the curtain, darkness lurks, symbolizing severity and the necessary contrast to appreciate the light.\nUltimately, the artwork celebrates the duality between those who paint to showcase beauty and harmony and those who enjoy and share, toasting to the past, present, and future. Regardless of social status or beliefs, we are all climbers, seeking the light emanating from the same Sun, converging in the infinite spiral of evolution.\nLINKS: \nSince i have no social media presence, i have created this presentation to show my work to the judges.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9H3IevhI_V5zHJoQGaiwk_ASYyYIrc0/view?usp=drivesdk\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Theater-of-Life.png,952,1273,7804783,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x912f319096cffffa42b00f662b3ed7e933e4819d/1
11753,Supersymmetry (string quartet),"Supersymmetry (string quartet)\nMinted on the Superchain\nJanuary 2024\n### Program Notes\nSupersymmetry is a contemporary work for string quartet by composer Thomas Vieira. This piece is inspired by the mystery of space and time, and the unseen realities humming beneath the surface of everyday experience.\nEvolving over the course of 5 movements (~9 minutes), Supersymmetry employs a striking compositional language to tell a story of science and art combined. What begins as a straightforward exercise to ‚Äúcount the spheres‚Äù quickly escalates, bearing away the listener through microscopic worlds of infinite complexity and hidden dimensions where nothing is what it appears.\nThe musical journey continues through new yet strangely familiar worlds, with powerful plucked rhythms and suspenseful, snake-like melodies adding to the mystery. Together we approach a shared revelation, until the final breakthrough occurs and we experience reality on its own terms ‚Äî a breathtaking, all-encompassing oneness that touches our hearts and enlivens our minds.\n### Movements\n1.

In the midst of our lighthearted play, an &#8221;optimistic&#8221; spirit prevailed, transcending the lack of royal accessories. We took turns, making sure everyone got a chance to experience the fun without any formal decisions, just going with the flow and embracing the joy of the moment.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/D9FCBB99-7DED-4652-8C95-4A39FE961398.jpeg,1080,1080,174389,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x4894902b599ded94dfb2143c1d1644e9ecb285ab/1/

The farm stickers were a big hit too.\nThere were some minor fights and delays in the creative process due to things like needing to eat and do homework but everyone was very happy with the result. Once it was done we taped it to the wall and took a picture with my phone that became the image in the NFT. \nInitially, I was planning on sketching something myself, in the time I would carve for myself away from my family over the holidays. It was going to be more of a detailed city scene with some people looking at their phones and NFT art as graffiti on the walls and things of that nature.

11642,COMPLETION: To write with a running brush (2024 broadside),"This AI-powered poem was first published by the Asian American Writers&#8217; Workshop in their Zuihitsu special issue, and is part of COMPLETION POEMS, an ongoing series begun in 2018 co-created with my alter ego, Technelegy, a custom-trained version of a language model (in this case, GPT-3) that uses machine learning to create original, human-sounding verse. Our writing process often begins with compiling a data set that reflects specific information and inspiration, focusing the machine‚Äôs poetic mind via lists of sample inputs and completions. Then I prompt my co-author with ‚Äúseed‚Äù words and phrases that trigger responses which in turn become new prompts, and so on. The resulting outputs are a kind of cybernetic zuihitsu &#8211; each thought directly eliciting the next, styles and forms shifting without warning to create a cascade of words tethered by algorithmic associations, semantic patterns and augmented imagination.\nIn this version of the poem, I have used the recursive technique explored throughout my REPETAE series to investigate resonances between linguistic pattern recognition and poetic repetition, and to embody the polyphony (or cacophony) of AI authorship, as well as the uncanny yet deeply familiar feeling of collaborating with a more-than-human mind. The term &#8220;broadside&#8221; refers to a method of printing and distribution that became popular after the invention of moveable type in the 1400s, and posits the literary use case of blockchain as next-gen printing press.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/running-brush-cover.png,1623,2951,1604518,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x66ad17f04b641eee111367c8dbf9ffdc06f09353/1

A digital autumn space, created by the union of Blender 3D, Adobe Illustrator and photogrammetry. In technical terms it is composed of a background image, a 3D scan, a main sphere where the HDRI used in the entire 3D scene is reflected (which determines the lighting of the entire project) and where organic sculptures placed in front of the sphere are also reflected (which can only be seen through the reflection of the sphere). In the lower plane I also placed organic sculptures distributed throughout the space to give volume and make them dialogue with the 2D scene. It is a surreal world, an image that shows us that the digital can dialogue with an organic and naturally mutant world. Just look closely through this magic ball, which shows us a new world hidden in the depth of flatness. The retouching of light, reflections and camera blur was done in Adobe Illustrator.\nPersonally I am fascinated with being able to create natural and organic fantasy worlds with my computer. It&#8217;s just a power that technology gives me. Dystopian, acidic worlds, with fauna and flora altered not by man, but by my decisions in conjunction with technology and software.

11577,Aurora,"Jagged and asymmetrical peaks colored in the soft hues of sunrise. Aurora explores the beauty and complexity of nature, mathematics, and code. Inspired by the raw and desolate beauty of the alpine tundra with widely varying landscapes juxtaposed by open skies. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\nAurora combines randomness, noise, and algorithms to create a variety of shapes, colors, and gradients that resemble the mountain scenery. Each image is composed of multiple layers of triangles, curves, circles, and points, each with its own logic and parameters.\nThe result is a harmonious and organic composition that reflects the diversity and richness of nature all derived entirely from code.\nProcess:\nThe creation process begins with the generation of mountain silhouettes using Perlin noise, a technique that produces natural-looking, smooth random sequences. This method allows for the creation of rolling hills and rugged peaks, akin to real-world landscapes. The sky is rendered with a blend of colors, simulating various times of day, from the soft hues of early dawn to the vibrant tones of midday.\nTo add depth and realism, layers of mountains are rendered with varying levels of transparency, creating a sense of distance. The placement and height of each mountain range are randomized in each iteration, ensuring no two scenes are identical.\nTools Used:\np5.js: A JavaScript library that offers a wide range of creative coding functionalities. It provided the tools for rendering shapes, colors, and noise patterns. \nHighlight.js: Utilized for integrating deterministic randomness, ensuring that each art piece is both unique and reproducible. This tool was essential for aligning the artwork with the principles of blockchain and NFTs. \nGithub Repo: https://github.com/JonathanH4H/Aurora\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Aurora-Preview.png,1144,1148,301817,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/659b554263f21afad40913e9

It mirrors the enduring struggle, reminiscent of Sisyphus, as I relentlessly pursue my dreams and strive for freedom. The artwork encapsulates the ongoing battle against setbacks and obstacles, portraying a visual narrative that resonates with the complexities of navigating personal aspirations within a capitalist society.\nThe sound design in this piece aims to replicate the white noise present when we inhabit our personal realms‚Äîbe it the voices of familial scrutiny or the background hum of mundane interviews‚Äîeverything blurs into a unified auditory backdrop.\nDespite the seemingly fruitless efforts, whether seeking regular employment or facing rejection in the art world, I have developed a thicker skin through these experiences. The constant rejection, while heartbreaking, has become a catalyst for perseverance. I continue to forge ahead, embracing every opportunity with pride, regardless of the outcome.\nThis piece holds special significance as it pays tribute to my life before Web3, where I was trapped in the monotonous routine of standardised work patterns and dead ends. Emotionally, my world has undergone a profound transformation. Despite still facing rejection, I feel immensely liberated by the opportunities and companionship offered by this space.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sisyphus-2023.png,3838,2160,4161108,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x9253277c0fc17b46d22b3cdab5d21db4f947c850/1

11529,Jagged Harmony,"Jagged Harmony is part of an extensive exploration into the fusion of ancient and modern art forms. Over the years, I have delved deeply into the practice of yantra, an art form with roots in India dating back thousands of years, traditionally used for meditation. My work reinterprets this ancient practice through the lens of contemporary abstract calligraphy, particularly using the strokes of blackletter typography from styles like Textura Quadrata and Fraktur, which originated in the 12th century.\nThis artwork is a distinct fusion of these contrasting elements. The initial design, crafted through a blend of traditional methods and personal creativity, is subsequently reimagined using AI. This process breathes new life into the structured forms of Western typography and the fluid nature of yantra. &#8216;Jagged Harmony&#8217; aptly describes this endeavor: it is a commentary on how AI can reinterpret and invigorate the creative process and even enhance ancient traditional forms, resulting in novel and provocative harmonies.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jagged-harmony.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,"Manifold,Stability AI",https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x528fd133d6fb004faccc08b70e04186299eba176/1
11527,1099-DA,"‚Äò1099-DA‚Äô is an AI generated, interactive piece of art. It employs AI, game mechanics, humor, and NFTs to satirize the regulatory landscape of blockchain in the US. The project allows collectors to experience the overwhelming requirement of the newly proposed 1099-DA form. A low estimate of 8-9 Billion of these forms will be submitted to the IRS if the rules go into effect. Because this art is interactive, I invite you to watch a 1-minute video of &#8216;1099-DA&#8217; (https://youtu.be/qE5YxMgzJJU), that shows much of what is articulated below.\n‚Äò1099-DA‚Äô is composed of 1099 NFTs, which showcase caricature-like portraits of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel on different types of currency. The images were created using a series of custom trained Stable Diffusion models (more on the exact process below).\n‚Äò1099-DA‚Äô utilizes custom smart contracts to engage collectors with a parody of the proposed 1099-DA form. NFT owners can call the &#8216;exchangeCurrency&#8217; function, altering their NFT‚Äôs meta-data. Each NFT can be changed to show a different political appointee; Gensler, Yellen, or Werfel. Changing an NFT on 1099DA.art (the project‚Äôs site), will create a satirical, AI-generated 1099-DA Form. Collectors then have the opportunity to mint the 1099 as an NFT by calling the ‚Äòsubmit1099ToIRS‚Äô function. This not only adds another unique AI-generated NFT to their collection but allows them to experience the ridiculousness of generating and submitting these forms for simply ‚Äòexchanging‚Äô their NFT. The prompts and data used to create these fake documents are pulled from the meta-data of the NFTs in the project. This real-world use case of tracking input and output data for AI with NFTs is overlooked by current regulators.\nIf the ‚Äò1099-DA‚Äô collection ever hits a critical majority, where two-thirds (733) of NFTs are changed to the same appointee, every NFT in the series will permanently lock to showcase that appointee. This mechanism is analogous to congress clarifying the regulatory landscape with a two-thirds vote. This is a twist for collectors as their NFTs may unpredictably shift from rare to common or vice-versa. \nBelow outlines the process used for creating the images of the NFTs. Each image is purely AI-generated, there was no post-processing (e.g. Photoshop) of any output images:\n‚Ä¢ Several V2.1-768px Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate distinct and iconic types of US currency from 1870s Gold Certificates to present day Federal Reserve Notes.\n‚Ä¢ Thousands of currency images were generated and curated down to 12 based on their style and aesthetic. Particular attention was paid to curating images with similar framing and drop shadows (these were not added or changed in post processing software).\n‚Ä¢ Next several new Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate caricatures in the likeness of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel.\n‚Ä¢ Using Stable Diffusion‚Äôs Automatic1111 interface, humorous images of the appointees were inpainted onto the 12 currency types. 10,000+ images were generated and curated into a final set of 1099 for each appointee.\n‚Ä¢ Finally, for the rarest currency type, the Gold Certificate, the artist used a special process with inpainting in Automatic1111 to add the words ‚ÄòGold God.‚Äô This element was added purely in Stable Diffusion. No post-processing software (e.g. Photoshop) was used on the output images.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Artwork_Image.png,400,400,302587,1of1s,"OpenSea,Stability AI",https://opensea.io/collection/1099-da

11523,Es Asi Que vos Miras,"&#8220;It&#8217;s so you look&#8221; (Es asi que vos miras) is a song that transmits a message of personal search and discovery. With a captivating melody and thoughtful lyrics, this song evokes deep emotions and feelings.\nThe song begins with the phrase &#8220;Today, today I go out to search, today, today I go out to find&#8221;, which reflects the determination to go out in search of something meaningful. The protagonist recognizes that he is not a complete person without the presence of someone special in his life. The verse &#8220;That I am not just one is because of you&#8221; shows the importance of that person in his existence.\nThroughout the song, the idea is highlighted that the presence of that special person is vital to your happiness. The phrase &#8220;And if it hurts you live&#8221; expresses how that person&#8217;s well-being influences their own life. Even though you are not present at that moment, he or she knows that you will go in search of your purpose and move forward, even if you do not know how to do so.\nThe song also refers to the deep connection between two people. Through the verses &#8220;And this is how you look, because in your sun there is the sea, there is the sea&#8221;, the importance of that person in your life is highlighted and how their presence is like the sun that illuminates your path and fills you. your world of possibilities.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023_DESPERTAR-Martin-Catoira-IMAGEN-PRINCIPAL-01-scaled.jpg,1668,2560,1070319,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x3fe4a2a3099fe1fcab820536e33cac818cb3a59a/1

11475,Keep Moving (Final Submission),"The chorus is from one of my first songs written when I went through my depression. When I finally opened up about it in 2020, I revisited a lot of early work and reconnected with this song. While a pandemic was taking over the world, I found myself drawing strength to move on with working on my album through this song. After locking myself away to go through my creative process for a few weeks during winter, a few tracks were produced. ‚ÄúKeep Moving‚Äù made me feel grounded and gave me the confidence I needed to just keep on moving. \nDue to a lack of funding, the album production was going slower than expected. Mid 2023 I started to explore alternative ways to connect with my listeners and distribute my album to the world. A close friend recommended me to explore a platform called [sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz). to see how I can leverage this to cultivate a closer connection to my audience. Interestingly, I also saw this as a way to create an additional source of income. This is how I stumbled upon Web3 music. After posting for a while and interacting with Optimism, I found out about this competition. \nAs an artist, it‚Äôs difficult to choose a song for a competition because you never know based on what people will judge you. However, after organising multiple listening sessions in 2023 and experiencing my first bear market, I felt like ‚ÄúKeep Moving‚Äù embodied the feeling most of us had these last years in different parts of our lives. Even though I never got my big break as an artist, this track always reminded me to keep going because the purpose of my music is bigger than fame. I want my creations to bring people closer and empower them in a meaningful way. \nI can say that this song has saved my life. I hope through the recognition this track can get with the We Love The Art competition, it could save other people‚Äôs lives too. Winning any tier of this competition will not only push me closer to realizing a bigger impact through my music but also magnify the message of this song to millions of listeners who can use it as a reminder to keep on moving.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-01.01.25.png,529,650,291177,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/levisilvanie/keep-moving

11469,Subject #102,"Subject #102 invites an exploration into the dubiety of existence through a perplexing world that ceases to be. In a human-machine collaboration, chaotic and surreal renditions of reality offer stolen glimpses into a parallel world that is bizarrely like our own. Here, the lines between the real and artificial are blurred, leaving us to question the limits of our own existence. \nThe scene introduces a synthetic realm in which the boundaries of our tangible world are broken, leaving the uncanny to become a perpetual occurrence. It conveys a sense of disorder that characterises our presence, while also highlighting the fragility and ambiguity of life. In its obscurity, we are urged to question our own perceptions of reality and become engrossed in a dubious world of the improbable and absurd. \nThis world evokes a sense of curiosity and unease, it is both elegant and disconcerting, as if part of a larger, interconnected whole. It can be seen as a passage of escape from the constraints of our own reality. \nThe creation process for this post photographic piece is what I consider to be a collaborative effort between human and machine. I utilised an amalgamation of various AI systems and digital tools to bring my concept to fruition. I began working with a Midjourney v5 model, using text prompts to generate initial imagery and altering various parameters as a way of experimentation. Once I had established a strong and intriguing collection of images to work with, I meticulously curated the most successful output before taking it further into Adobe Photoshop. This image was then gradually manipulated digitally using the application‚Äôs tools, generative fill was especially useful here. (I revisited the work for a few months before I deemed it a final piece.) Finally, I upscaled the edited image using Magnific AI. I explored various creative parameters, allowing the AI to transform the image one last time. \nI describe this process as a collaboration as it involved a reciprocal exchange of ideas. My ideas evolved in response to the AI&#8217;s outputs, and similarly, the AI modified its outputs in accordance with my developing perspective. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/katiemorris-subject102.png,1845,2760,9757105,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x9e5e561ec369f1e7d50d4fc0b5af0063fcc7821f/1

11451,Live at Spuyten Duyvil,"This moment marks a significant milestone in my journey as a creator.\nWhenever I perform modular sets, I often feel overwhelmed by the urge to stop. The music seems too repetitive, the audience appears unengaged, and a barrage of reasons why I should &#8220;stop playing right now!&#8221; floods my mind.\nTypically, I succumb to that internal voice and end my sets prematurely. However, I decided to challenge myself and signed up for a two-hour set to overcome these doubts.\nAs I prepared for this longer set, familiar nerves, worries, and doubts surfaced. In the first 20 minutes, I was anxious about how to engage the audience for the remaining 100 minutes.\nBut then, something clicked. I entered a state of flow. When I next checked the clock, I was surprised to find that 90 minutes had passed and only 30 minutes remained. Despite wondering again how to fill the time, I persisted.\nWhen I looked up once more, I had achieved it! I completed the full two-hour set.\nThis video isn&#8217;t the entirety of those two hours due to my phone battery dying, but it serves as tangible evidence that I am capable of playing for as long as necessary.

11413,GHOST.,"WE ARE ALL GHOSTS.\nGhosts of our former selves. Ghosts of where we&#8217;ve been and what we&#8217;ve seen. Ghosts of our former expectations and dreams.\nIf not cared for, these ghosts will continuously haunt us until we truly confront them and learn to LOVE them.\nGHOST. is a haunting song about love, loss and loneliness. It ºs a song about the realization that the future vision one may have had about their life is just a ghost vision that will never come to be. \nIt ºs a song about reflecting on the past, and realizing that those versions of yourself are not who you are any\nlonger. They are just ghosts of your current self.\nGHOST. was written, performed, produced and mixed by myself. It was written when I was living up in the foggy mountains of Southern California. I remember coming up with the bass line for it at around 11 pm, which instantly consumed me. I lost time completely and wrote and produced the whole song that evening. I eventually came out of my haze at about 6 AM and had the bulk of the production done. Over the course of the next few days I wrote lyrics, recorded my vocals, edited and then mixed the song.\nGHOST. was also the first song where I decided to get over the limiting beliefs regarding my singing voice, and sing on my own material. Because of this, I chose for it to be my musical genesis drop on chain. \nThere are two versions of the song: The original, fully produced version (95/100 NFTs) as well as a one take, piano and voice acoustic version (5/100 NFTs), for a total collection of 100 NFTs.\nThe song was produced and mixed in Ableton Live 11 and I sang, performed, produced and mixed it all myself. \nFrom a visual standpoint, the collection is made up of generative covers which link to additional token gated artwork based on the trait rarity of said covers. There will also be a token gated link, to a very limited sample library of my own one-shots and some Serum (a virtual synth) presets based on the trait rarity of the covers.\nThe token gated artworks consist of 10 different ghosts of my past self as both .png images as well as .mp4 video loops which contain audio snippets and are perfectly loopable. \nThese 10 ghosts were made using a combination of photography, AI (via Midjourney and an AI upscaler), Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier as well as by using the audio stems from the original version of GHOST. and reworking them into new, small, remixed snippets of the song, via Ableton Live 11 (the DAW I work in). \nI self-shot myself, then took the photos into Midjourney and used them as prompts. When I received outputs I was happy with, I brought them into Photoshop and edited as needed. From there I brought them into Lightroom to color correct to taste and finally into Premier to add the visual edits as well as add the remixed audio.\nI also edited and colored the single cover itself. \nVisually, I chose to go with the blue tones for this song because it&#8217;s a very forlorn and somber song. It touches upon sadness, loneliness and the general feeling of being haunted. The color blue perfectly evokes these feelings in me and I feel the song, in fact, &#8220;sounds blue&#8221; if I were to tap into it synesthetically. \nIn terms of the mechanics of the mint, it happened in 2 phases. Phase 1 was where collectors could mint the &#8220;mintpass&#8221; which granted them access to minting the GHOST. NFT. The mintpass was sold on OP mainnet and was a great way to take advantage of Optimism&#8217;s low gas infrastructure and speed. (Link to mintpasses here: https://opensea.io/collection/nifty-music-floor-drop-mintpasses-1)\nPhase 2 was where all holders of the mintpasses were able to mint the GHOST. NFT via token gated access. The GHOST. NFT itself was deployed on ETH mainnet, (link above), but Optimism played a huge role in these mechanics as well as in trying out new methods to avoid mints getting botted and ensuring that those who are TRULY fans of the project won&#8217;t have to worry about fighting high gas fees during peak minting times on ETH mainnet. \nYou can find links to the two versions of the song and the additional artworks here: https://app.box.com/s/ncwiuhfuknbhbev5me8yaf3pyo56p30v\nYou can find a quick look into the process of creating the visual artwork here: https://x.com/architect_eth/status/1717625845727261056?s=20\nThank you for reading and I appreciate the opportunity!\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GHOST_Vinyl-Cover-Image.png,1024,1024,1466178,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/collection/ghost-by-alone-architect

11391,The Tower,"The Tower card in the Tarot is one of the most striking and ominous cards one can receive. The card represents sudden change, destruction, chaos, and upheaval, but also release and liberation. The Tower can be a difficult card to face, as it often indicates that a difficult period of change is imminent or already occurring. This card usually appears when problematic patterns in an individual‚Äôs life have reached an apex, and a shocking event is required to bring awareness to the need for change. Disruption is necessary for growth and can lead to a stronger, healthier and more authentic self once it has passed.\nIn the traditional Tarot this card depicts a tower being struck by lightning. In this card, the symbol of the Tower is represented by a tall server rack used for crypto mining. The towering mining rig has exploded, sending machinery cascading to the ground. Large, descending red candles burn violently in the background, representing a sudden and dramatic market crash. These sudden and dramatic crashes can be painful, but they are a necessary stage in the market‚Äôs evolution and ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient industry overall. \nThis artwork is part of a larger ongoing series, a full crypto Tarot deck. Each card is a unique 1 of 1 with its own narrative and meaning that stands on its own. I chose to submit the maximum of two of the cards to the We ‚ù§Ô∏è the Art contest, one to the AI art category and one to the 1of1 category. \nThis artwork was created with Visual Electric, and AI art tool that uses Stable Diffusion for image generation, and adapted edited quite a bit in Photoshop. I collaged two different AI generated images, one of the server tower and one of the candles, and adjusted the candles into a descending pattern to mimic a crypto chart during a crash. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thetower.jpg,1278,958,914922,1of1s,Manifold,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xc32ed9d3a3385fd9fa7738a73751fc5a7e5b0eac/1
11389,Abismo Emocional,"Mexi&#8217;s photography is a testament to the symbiotic relationship between human endeavor and the pristine landscapes that cradle these feats. His concept revolves around capturing the essence of adventure, encapsulating the raw emotions, challenges, and triumphs experienced in the wild.\nMexis&#8217;s process is an immersive dance with nature. He starts by meticulously planning each adventure, understanding the terrain, weather conditions, and potential obstacles. Once on-site, he embraces spontaneity, allowing the environment to dictate the narrative. Through candid shots and deliberate compositions, he weaves a visual story that resonates with the essence of the moment.\nThis photo was taken with a DJI Osmo Pocket 2, a compact and versatile handheld camera designed for capturing stabilized and high-quality footage.

11381,The Fool,"The Fool is the first card of every Tarot deck, it marks the start of the journey through the archetypes of the Tarot. The Fool represents stepping into the unknown with a sense of openness and optimism. It&#8217;s the card of pure potential. It challenges the viewer to leap into new experiences with the innocence and courage of The Fool, who is yet untouched by the lessons of the Tarot.\nMost Tarot decks present the Fool as a carefree character stepping off a cliff. This scene shows a figure sitting atop a cliff, staring at green charts, surrounded by vast riches, but are they real? Or imaginary? The Fool archetype corresponds with the energy and excitement of first time crypto market participants, who typically join the market amidst a sea of glowing green god candles and tales of unbelievable fortune. In crypto trading, a ‚Äúgod candle‚Äù is a massive green candle in a candlestick trading chart, indicating a rapid and massive rise in the price of a coin. Here this concept is represented with literal green candles. The start of the Fool‚Äôs adventure is full of naive optimism. This optimism is tempered, but not lost, along the journey through the archetypes of the Tarot.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thefool.jpg,1278,958,775755,1of1s,"Manifold,Stability AI",https://titles.xyz/collect/zora/0xc04c5b13a1c5a447eaf01fddd01bb8b1b47557f5

The crypto market chart, with its peaks, echoes the promise of growth, mirroring the ever-evolving landscape of the blockchain.\nWithin this enigmatic canvas, a unicorn stands as a beacon of dreams materializing through technology. It symbolizes the pursuit of prosperity, an ethereal vision that emerges from the digital realm. Birds, my signature in the cryptic lexicon of my painting style, flutter through the scene, representing the freedom and transcendence that technology, especially blockchain, can bring.\nProcess and Tools:\nThe genesis of my artwork begins with the chaos of programming codes and blockchain intricacies. The first layer, representing this digital cacophony, is generated by an AI tool, the ‚ÄúAirt‚Äù app. It lays the foundation for the enigma that unfolds.

(this is the longest part of the process)\n2. Create a noise field algorithm and apply these items to the canvas using this algorithm.\n3. Higher noise values appear on top of lower noise values.\n4.

11234,We Were Younger Yesterday,"(For High Quality video visit mint link!)\nWelcome to ‚ÄúWe were younger yesterday‚Äù a music video infused with a short film that paints the story behind the meaning of the track. \nWe were younger yesterday is a piece that introduces the problems our society faces in today&#8217;s day in age. The concept of this music video is to showcase the magnitude of lost dreams. There are millions of people with stories to tell through their art but they refuse to take action because of fear. Jobs, societal pressure, family, and so much more keep people in a life of despair. The reason I am so fond of sharing this message is because I was a victim to this fearful mentality before I dropped out of college. I was taking every action in life based on the needs and perception of other people that I failed to fuel the passion and aspirations I knew I always had inside of me.\nNow that I am 22 and have been chasing my dreams for about 6 years, I talk to a lot of people and friends caught in the bear trap of fear. So many people with ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù that they will never get answered because they decided to take the road of satisfying society rather than themselves. You are only getting older, and the hardest lesson we all learn is that time is the most valuable thing we own, and regret tastes terrible. Remember that YOU were younger yesterday, so don‚Äôt waste anymore time.\nAlthough the meaning of the video and song is extensive, I thought it was very important to keep the song short, fun, and digestible. Being from the United States, a lot of times us creatives close ourselves off to any outside influences and genres because they are out of our comfort zone. This was the first time in my musical journey that I decided it was time to explore a sound that I have never indulged in before &#8211; Drums and Bass. I produced, recorded, mixed, and mastered the entire track myself in my bedroom. I knew that I had to create a visual surrounding the track to convey the overall meaning behind the liquid UK garage sounds. We filmed this video in an office I rented in Brooklyn, NYC. The people featured in the video also happen to be my past co-workers from when I used to serve food trays at the hospital. I thought this was important because it symbolizes all of our desire to get out and just live life the way we want to live it.\nI believe this submission contributes to the larger conversation surrounding the adoption of cryptos and super chains because it aligns with exactly what we are facing &#8211; Fear. Most people in this world hear about crypto and immediately close their ears off because it is human nature to completely be fearful of new technology that is potentially world changing. The idea behind the video is to convey that you should not let fear hold you back especially when it is for something that can change the lives of so many individuals. This is exactly what crypto and L2s have the potential to do, we just need people to stop being fearful and start taking charge of their own reality. \nI will use the prize tokens to further the intention of my submission by continuing my mission to seductively onboard the rest of the music industry into on-chain music. I will contribute half of it towards the Underground Violet Rave community which will help create a foundation of various shows across X, TikTok, and Instagram where we can educate the youth through music and the empowerment of L2s. The remaining half I will use to truly elevate my music career and really double down on the art. To do shows around the country like we are already doing with the Underground Violet Rave, and to be very intentional with expanding my opportunities to make even better music than is being created right now in my bedroom! \n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xeeaf29f23cf2b57a1f432fe434cf982cfa7584b2/1?referrer=0x7933231775dEc3f3c80039DEbd7E3afD8A81f674

11213,Echo of Ancient Worlds,"Dear Judges,\nAs I present to you my artwork, &#8220;Echo of Ancient Worlds&#8221; I wish to impart the conceptual framework and prompt that have been instrumental in shaping this creation, offering you a deeper appreciation of my artistic endeavor.\nThe prompt that initiated the journey of this piece was designed to weave together surrealism and mythology, setting the tone and direction for the composition. It envisioned a tapestry of mythical legends and symbols, each element complementing and enhancing one another to form a complex and harmonious scene. A mystical lake, the waterfall of time, a majestic unicorn, and the sturdy tree of life‚Äîall come together to craft a tableau where the earthly merges with the cosmic, and myth becomes manifest.\nThe concept behind the work breathes life into this prompt, inviting the viewer on an odyssey through an ancient mythological universe. Light and shadow play a pivotal role, with golden and blue hues transitioning into each other, embodying the duality of the terrestrial and celestial. Light effects add magic and mystery, making the scene come alive.\nIn realizing this vision, I utilized ChatGPT as a creative partner to fine-tune the elements of my art. It served as a collaborative tool in refining the ideas that have ultimately taken visual form.\nThrough these elements‚Äîthe prompt and the concept‚ÄîI aimed not merely to depict myths visually but to evoke a sense of awe and wonder that beckons viewers to return, discovering new facets with each viewing.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo_2024-01-08_01-54-30.jpg,1280,1280,768363,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xdf696d24703fe58c85d0d533f36d8c1b9ab4b126/2

11202,Pastoral Dissociation,"The theme behind &#8216;Pastoral Dissociation&#8217; is the disillusionment with the possibility of a natural order, in which the boundaries of our inner world can be defined and expressed in reassuring lyrical stereotypes.\nThe piece is a criticism of the very concept of identity and memory and wants to provoke all those who express overconfidence in appealing to their ego which is instead seen as a mutable concept whose intrinsic mystery does not lend itself to being easily confined. The surrealism of the piece leaves much else unsaid and requires the observer&#8217;s participation in the illusory and ephemeral search for the attribution of meaning. The sought-after aesthetic describes the contrast between natural and rural elements and, on the other hand, the disintegration and deconstruction of the human inner and outer structure.\nThe piece has been obtained using Midjourney, text to image with a specific prompting that has been developed in months. Adobe Lightroom has been then used for the editing.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Luke-Gr1ndhouse-Pastoral-Dissociation.png,2333,1867,8950992,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x008713fe7831618d18abf41992031eb0960331d6/1

11189,The goal is the path,"I first sought the moral principle that has been accompanying me the most lately. I immediately focused on the following principle: &#8220;the important thing is not the destination but the journey.&#8221; Afterward, I wanted to illustrate it graphically using specialized software. I used a program called &#8220;Imagine,&#8221; specifically designed to generate images from explanatory text. I crafted several prompts before discovering the one that produced the most compelling images for me.\nFrom this refined prompt, I generated over 60 images, continually refining the prompt for optimal results. After this thorough process, I preselected 12 images out of the 60. I then composed an initial text and juxtaposed it with each image as part of this presentation. This iterative process led me to select the image I am presenting to you, the one that best reflects the essence of my journey.\nThis representation aims to graphically illustrate the idea that in the face of a life path one wishes to be marvelous, transcending even the stars, the presentation suggests above all that the importance lies in the inner quest.\nHere, fulfillment does not manifest beyond the clouds or among the stars, but it flourishes in the inner flight, where the treasure is found in the beat of each wing. Instead of fixing one&#8217;s gaze on a distant destination, this gentle vision reminds us that the true magic resides in the dance of steps, in the symphony of choices that weave the fabric of our being. Thus, the essence of the thought is that the important thing is not the destination, but the journey itself, no matter how beautiful it may be.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wilkinson-Path-2024.png,768,768,947555,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/arbitrum/0x12a17e8becedd2e5073e41c5e905b4c3ef59f207/2/

11176,MASTERPIECE,"&#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; isn&#8217;t just a masterpiece, it&#8217;s a reclaiming of power‚Äì an affirmation of strength in the midst of life&#8217;s transitions. After significant shifts‚Äì leaving my role as Head of Artist Relations at Sound.xyz (where I onboarded several hundreds of artists into Web3), navigating personal changes, and embracing new seasons, this piece has become my anthem for self-reclamation entering into the new year. It is a reminder of my identity and resilience, a testament to the strength inherent in all of us.\nSince its release in December, I‚Äôve watched &#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; resonate globally, racking up over 330K views across various platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok. If chosen as a winner, I&#8217;d be honored to continue to share the progressive story of this work by celebrating the victory across my social media network (113K TikTok followers, 45K on Twitter, and 23K on Instagram) to bring more awareness to Optimism and this impactful initiative for creatives.\nIt is my belief that this piece has resonated so strongly around the world because many people can see themselves in it‚Äì and to me, that‚Äôs what the best art does. The relatability of this work serves as a mirror to viewers&#8217; own triumphs and endurance, to their own value and power. \nWhat I love most about this piece is the natural progression of artistic collaboration. Kaelin&#8217;s production sparked the creation of this work, crafting this Bossa Nova vibe using his own sounds. He posted a step-by step video detailing the production process that caught my attention, and I reached out to ask if I could add lyrics to it. After creating the song, I put on my director hat and visualized performing within a picture frame. I found the perfect production studio to actualize the vision and reached out to Isaiah Pearce who shot this video using a Black Magic Ursa Mini Pro. Next, Takai the Artist sealed the deal, editing everything in Adobe Premiere and Davinci Resolve for color correction.\nShould we win this contest, these funds would propel Kaelin and I‚Äôs upcoming collaborative album, ‚ÄúChrysalis‚Äù, a story about acceleration and internal transformation. Funds will also go towards production, marketing, and the creation of a 10-minute visual album companion. With our earnings, we will be able to bring more creators onboard, onchain, and be a living testament to how far online collaboration can go. Winning would not only honor my artistic journey, but also allow us to share my message of resilience and optimism with my 181K+ combined social media followers, spreading the power of creative expression and resilience. \nIf all of my life‚Äôs transitions last year led to the birth of this &#8220;Masterpiece,&#8221; let the record show that every step, however challenging, was worth it in the end.\nThank you so much for your time and consideration!\n________\nRelated Links:\nIman Europe on X: https://twitter.com/ImanEurope\nIman Europe on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@imaneurope\nIman Europe on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/imaneurope/\nKaelin Ellis on X: https://twitter.com/kaelinellis\nKaelin Ellis on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kaelinellis\nKaelin Ellis on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kaelinellis/\nIsaiah Pearce: https://www.instagram.com/isaiahraypearce/\nTakai the Artist: https://www.instagram.com/takaitheartist/\nKaelin Ellis &#8211; making of ‚ÄúMasterpiece‚Äù: https://www.tiktok.com/@kaelinellis/video/7184826188303486251?lang=en\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Iman-Europe-MASTERPIECE-cover-art-scaled.jpg,2560,2560,809188,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x31cf018325a84fc36ef2a69756a03b9aaf46724c/1

The landscape, cloaked in an abundance of snow and enduring cold, serves as a raw canvas for my artistic expression.\nIn this wintry and chilly artwork, I sought to capture not only the visual spectacle but also to convey a hidden message about the prevailing alienation that permeates various layers of our world today. The chilling temperatures and the snow-laden scenery mirror a broader, metaphorical coldness that defines contemporary society.\nThe artistic process behind &#8220;S(now)&#8221; was a journey marked by clarity of vision and a touch of experimentation.

The process becomes an engaging quest, an odyssey of searching, testing, and refining. Each prompt reveals new possibilities, and in the dance between intention and serendipity, &#8220;S(now)&#8221; emerged as a testament to the dynamic interplay of creativity and technology.\nBeyond the frozen landscapes of Finland, the artwork echoes the broader human experience of searching for connection amidst a world marked by alienation. &#8220;S(now)&#8221; invites viewers to delve into the layers of meaning, where the chilling beauty of winter converges with the profound societal reflections embedded within the artwork.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/snow.png,896,1344,2292750,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0xe157f503771dd74a7a819c79d67bb004cb353f09/1

11147,Great Lakes Wild Rice Cakes,"Born and raised in Northern Michigan, I always had an appreciation for the outdoors and foraging for my own food. Early in my culinary career, I was a line cook at a Native American casino. While I was familiar with wild rice, a Chippewa co-worker explained to me the importance of the food to his people and the region in general. Moving to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I was introduced to another regional favorite dish &#8220;Wisconsin Friday Fish Fry&#8221;. This was typically a deep fried Great Lakes fish, like walleye and perch, and was traditionally served with potato pancakes. Being at a Native American casino in Milwaukee as well, I wanted to create a fusion item that was delicious, approachable to the locals, and paid homage to the indigenous natives. It was a great success and has stayed in my recipe repertoire over the years, being slightly tweaked and perfected during my career. Like all my recipes, I test in prod. \nIt is my hope to bring an entirely different group of content creators on-chain. This type of intellectual property is ripe for disruption and modernization. There are so many stories to be told with food.\nThis recipe has been a labor of love over the past 15 years, going through countless critiques and revisions. The image was created using Google Docs and Microsoft Paint in about 15 minutes.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Great-Lakes-Wild-Rice-Cakes.png,961,1220,108545,1of1s,OpenSea,https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0xe08fdba77ba0379c649c1ad8ac03e80e0822709a/1/

11133,Magician Help,"&#8220;Harmony of Chaos&#8221; is a visual celebration of the dynamic equilibrium between structure and disarray, embodying the spirit of Optimism where diverse, vibrant elements come together to form a cohesive yet energetic whole. The artwork captures a fantastical realm where the arcane and the mechanical merge, weaving an intricate narrative of coexistence within the space of a canvas. At the heart of this bustling scene stands an aged wizard, a beacon of wisdom and knowledge, whose presence suggests that experience is the subtle conductor of innovation&#8217;s symphony.\nThe journey of this piece from concept to completion was a methodical one. It started with rough pencil sketches to determine the spatial harmony within the composition, emphasizing a blend of rigid and fluid forms. These initial sketches were then meticulously translated into a digital format, employing a graphic tablet which allowed for the precise linework and textural richness that characterizes the final image. Color was applied methodically in successive layers. The foundation was laid with a subdued color scheme to establish the overall mood, followed by successive applications of vivid hues and contrasting shadows to lend the piece its depth and resonance.\nDigital painting tools were integral to the process, providing a versatile platform for the artwork&#8217;s creation. The sophistication of the software&#8217;s brush engine facilitated the simulation of traditional painting techniques, while its advanced layer management enabled the complex overlay of textures and colors. No specific coding was involved; instead, the emphasis was on the manual manipulation of digital brushes and the artist&#8217;s interaction with the software to bring the envisioned scene to life.\nThis piece stands as a testament to the harmonious potential of chaos, a theme that resonates deeply with the ethos of Optimism. It is a snapshot of a world where every stroke and color serves a purpose, contributing to a larger narrative that champions diversity, balance, and the beauty of unified opposites.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/artworksubmission.png,915,732,1191902,1of1s,Manifold,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x6fe00d1bae0236ef1a803d32fe17601653bdac20/1

11081,Idyllic,"In August 2023 thirty-five individuals contributed to a Party crowdfund to assemble a hip-hop supergroup and send them to FWB Fest in Idyllwild, California. Inspired by the creative spirit of the Soulquarians we wanted to experiment with new models of collective collaboration to produce cultural artefacts that live forever. A creative moment in time, recorded permanently onchain.\nThe Party successfully raised 5 ETH (~$9300) which was used to cover artist fees, travel expenses, festival tickets and accommodation. With only four weeks until Fest we started reaching out to artists that we felt embodied the vibe and energy of the project to see if they‚Äôd be interested. Many of the artists we spoke to had no prior experience with web3 but were excited about the prospect of collaborating on a project that paid homage to the Soulquarians.\nThe artists arrived in Idyllwild on Friday and spent some time getting settled and exploring ideas for the songs. Coincidentally we found out all of the artists had collaborated with at least one other member in the past, which created an amazing synergy between the group.\nOn Saturday the Soulquest collective took over the studio, which The Park had set up for Fest, and recorded three incredible tracks in just four hours. The first track ‚ÄòMorning Sun‚Äô is a dreamy, rhythmic piece of music that evokes a sense of hopefulness. The second song ‚ÄòMilk N Honey‚Äô is a head-nodding hip-hop masterpiece and the final track ‚ÄòWanfunun‚Äô is a soulful story of female empowerment.\nHere‚Äôs what the artists had to say when reflecting on the experience:\n‚ÄúA natural joy that is needed in a world where everyone is going through something. To make art by three black women that are amazing musicians this joyful and abundant and full, it‚Äôs so important. That vibration is needed in the world. This project reminds me of a vibration house.‚Äù &#8211; V.C.R\n‚ÄúThis is such a feelgood project. A magical experience. We made this project in less than 3 hours. A lot of influences at once‚Äù &#8211; Swarvy\n‚ÄúThis project is one of the most urban rich collaborative projects web3 has ever had. Creating it at FWB Fest last August was truly a bonding experience, not only with the other artists, but with everyone who came to witness us make it. The perfect feel to start the new year with.‚Äù &#8211; Iman Europe\n‚ÄúThis project reconnected me with the other artists, and also blended soul, hip hop, jazz, classical music and everything we individually and collectively represent. It was like we were combining those energies easily, sort of automatically like the Soulquarians did. All of those elements are combined and I feel like we represent those elements too.‚Äù &#8211; Ill Camille\n‚Äî\nWe believe that music is art, and should be valued in the same way a painting or sculpture in a gallery is. This project captures a special moment in time and we have chosen to auction Idyllic as an exclusive 1/1 collectible. The proceeds from the auction and any future royalties will be split between the performers, visual artist, production team and contributors of the crowdloan using 0xsplits. Any prize money from the We Love The Art competition will also honour the same royalty split.\nWe minted a mixed version of the three songs as an ERC-721 token on Manifold, complete with cover artwork by Shawntel Johnson. Using Tokenbound (ERC-6551) we turned the NFT into a token bound account that can own other assets, then minted each track individually and sent them to the NFTs wallet address.

11056,real,"‚Äúreal‚Äù is our take on the euphoria of London‚Äôs alternative clubbing culture. \nWe moved from our hometown in Lisbon, Portugal, to London in September 2020, in search of its pioneering electronic music community in the worst possible timing &#8211; the city was quiet for the first time due to the pandemic. As it recovered, we watched the city‚Äôs rebirth unfold and experienced, for the first time, its clubbing scene renewed. \nGoing out in London is an immersive and chaotic shared experience, just like the city itself. The toughness and originality that this city demands makes a mark on its people, and inevitably creates cultures and subcultures within electronic music that break barriers of creativity. \nAt 25, we fell in love with the city‚Äôs alternative club scene and decided to create our own spin on UK garage and electronica, merging it with our indie, pop and singer-songwriter background. At the same time, we were introduced to music NFTs and entered the web3 space.\n Over 18 months, as we developed our sound, we released our experiments as music NFTs first, garnering support from a tight-knit web3 community of electronic music fans. \nThis process eventually led us to ‚Äúreal‚Äù, an ode to the energy and adrenaline of the city&#8217;s clubbing culture, fully self recorded and produced in our home studio in south east London.\nThe song is fast paced and dramatic, as we tried to transmit a feeling of having to keep up with the track, the same way you would have to keep up with the city‚Äôs demanding nighttime energy. We achieved this by using future garage-inspired fast-paced drums and breathy vocals with weird harmonies.\nUsing a love pursuit metaphor, ‚Äúreal‚Äù starts with a protection ‚Äúprayer‚Äù as we dive into the night‚Äôs chaos ‚Äúgive me protection, to get you closer‚Äù, and later acknowledges how fleeting the adrenaline and euphoria are ‚ÄúI‚Äôll savour in your part time love, and wonder what makes you stay‚Äù.\nThe vocals were manipulated to be spacious and slightly distorted, in order to invoke an ethereal yet intense atmosphere for a close-to-spiritual clubbing experience. For percussion we used drum sounds mixed with samples that we‚Äôve recorded around the city in the past years &#8211; in the underground and bus, in streets and caf√©s, parties and parks. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n‚Äúreal‚Äù is deeply influenced by clubbing culture-defining genres such as dubstep, garage, electronica, and by artists like James Blake, Burial, Four Tet, and Mount Kimbie. \n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/vaarwell-real.png,1440,1440,2960047,1of1s,Sound.xyz,https://www.sound.xyz/vaarwell/real

My art is meant to be an outlet to try new things and explore creativity wherever it may lead.\nThis piece serves as a small reminder to myself to keep experimenting. To draw just for drawing sake. To know when to close that window with 100 tabs and open a new one.\nInspired by a dream.

10997,Catpurrccinos: A donation to a cat cafe &amp; rescue!,"This past holiday season my friends and I participated in a white-elephant gift exchange with a $50 limit. I did not want to gift a typical trinket or gag-gift. Instead, I gifted a $50 cat sponsorship to a local cat cafe: Catpurrccinos! But I didn&#8217;t want my gift recipient to leave empty handed so I also created a custom 1-of-1 piece of art with AI and minted it onchain for them to keep forever as a commemorative NFT!\nCatpurrccinos rescues cats and offers $50 sponsorships that helps one special cat with vaccinations, de-worming, spaying/neutering, daily food, litter, cleaning supplies, medical care, and more! I learned about this opportunity when Pawthereum (a project I&#8217;ve helped contribute to) recently sponsored 3 cats at Catpurrccinos this holiday season! (https://pawthereum.medium.com/pawthereum-community-makes-a-purr-fect-contribution-to-feral-to-family-abbbeab40a0e).\nTools used: Chat GPT&#8217;s DALLE plugin to create the image. This was the prompt that I used:\n&#8220;a photo realistic image of an orange cat sitting in a trendy cafe. the cat is wearing a knit winter sweater and a thick, bright orange beanie. the cat is also wearing thick black hipster reading glasses. the cat is sipping a latte in a white ceramic mug.&#8221;\nCanva: I took the image generated by DALLE and imported it into Canva to add text overlaying the image and some animations to make it feel more alive.\nThirdweb: I used Thirdweb to create the NFT contract using their Open Edition 721 Drop contract.\nOverall, the gift was a hit &#8211; it was a hot item because it was &#8220;stolen&#8221; in one of the white-elephant rounds! My friend was very excited to sponsor his new furry friend and receive his digital 1-of-1 NFT of a cat sitting in a cafe forever engrained on the Base L2 blockchain!\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Mint.fun,https://mint.fun/base/0xfb2e5614f6c45746ff175c56c2d1c595c0cd5ffe
10995,dreamcar,"&#8220;dreamcar&#8221; is a song written and performed by me, the traditionist (aka Joey B). The song is meant to express my mind and thoughts in that place between consciousness, sleep and dreams while driving home from a long road trip to the one I love and long to see. \nThe song was recorded in LA and San Francisco in a studio for the foundation tracks with musician friends, then a home studio in Fairfax, CA for additional overdubs. I sing all the vocals and perform most of the accompanying instruments besides the bass and drums. \nThe &#8220;moving lyricollage&#8221; is the visual I created to accompany the music and visually express the lyrics as the song progresses. My songs are all lyrically focused, and bringing these lyrics to life in a visual form was important to me. The visual is stop motion in which I used hundreds of still frames to piece together as a stop motion moving piece that reflect the elements of the lyrics, and hopefully capture the dreamlike nature of the song, while also expressing the playfulness and stream of consciousness of the music. \n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Manifold,https://app.manifold.xyz/c/dreamcar

Her tools were straightforward yet powerful ‚Äì digital brushes, a palette of surreal hues, and software that allowed her to manipulate light and texture in ways that traditional mediums could not.\nShe crafted the piece layer by layer, starting with the striking eye, a symbol of perception and inner worlds. Then, with careful precision, she added the melting streams of color, each drip a testament to the melting away of reality into the fantastical. The crystal prism came last, created with a digital rendering that brought a refractive clarity to the composition, encapsulating the vision and making the colors dance as if alive.\nHirangi&#8217;s concept was to merge the familiar with the fantastical, inviting viewers to see their emotions and imaginations reflected back at them.

Straddling fiction and reality, this project begins with The Birth of NEKRA, and will evolve into a series of live performances, on-chain collectibles, short films and AI research. \nWhat connects AI and Death? The Unknown.\nThe Birth of NEKRA begins an exploration of the questions at the heart of this parallel, while the specter of black box AI looms large in our times. The impenetrable inner workings of certain machine learning processes create gaps in human ability to gather information, an idea mirrored by the deep unknowns surrounding death and mortality.\nNEKRA is born from the void, from a place where the bounds of her capability are unchartered. We see her consuming data as she forms herself, a reference to the composite process of generative AI.\nMimicking AI‚Äôs own performativity as human, in the live-action production of The Birth of NEKRA, Baldwin performs as AI. As human creativity grapples with its future collaborator or its replacement, Baldwin has created an alter-ego that serves as a vessel for this conversation. \nAs an on-chain looping video, NEKRA‚Äôs birth is eternal.

During each performance, NEKRA interviews her subject and conducts tests to ascertain a subject‚Äôs perception and feelings about death using EEG monitors and sound inputs. Biometric data, sound, and video gathered from these performances will be integrated into the project‚Äôs future artistic output, a series of on-chain artistic artifacts.

10931,StarkNet Is Here,"I am fascinated by the L2s: Arbitrum, Optimism, and most recently, Stakrnet. In comparing these three, I created a story for Stakrnet because it seems that not everyone understands it like they do with Optimism and Arbitrum. I wanted to raise awareness about this piece of technology that solves a critical problem of the current state of the Ethereum network, which is high gas fees. I tried to illustrate this concept in nine different photos generated by Bing AI (https://www.bing.com/images/create).\nThe story begins with a former warrior who is living in the jungle, away from the world. He receives a letter informing him of a problem in the world, something like a growing darkness in another corner of the world. The warrior starts to create a plan to do something before too many people get damaged by the issue. He comes up with a plan to create an army of warriors and starts a journey towards the evil, which is high gas fees! Along this journey, the army comes across burned villages, which represent the apps in the Ethereum network that are left with dust because no one has money to use them as they are pretty expensive to use. At the next stop, which is the gateway of the Ethereum network, the army sees the Ethereum network, which has been shown as a big castle in fire and under attack. The battle results in the full capture of the castle and bringing stability to the network. In the last scene, we see a huge amount of coins flooded in blood, which shows that this victory came at a heavy cost during all these years.\nDesign steps:\nAs I mentioned earlier, I used Bing DALL¬∑E 3 to create all images.\nThen, I used Photoshop to combine all nine photos into one frame.\nFinally, I added multiple old paper textures, dust and dirt textures, and some scratches to give it a vintage book vibe style.\nI hope you like it.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Final.jpg,9720,9720,7291092,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x67f138166c116af8aaafdf8cb4efc8bc5e89e32b/1

10913,"Arria and Paetus, No. 2","The genesis of this composition lies in my encounter with Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent&#8217;s painting at the Saint Louis Art Museum, a poignant depiction of a moment from Roman history. The painting tells the tragic story of Arria and Paetus, a tale imbued with themes of honor and sacrifice. Arria, visiting her imprisoned husband Paetus, reminds him that suicide is the honorable choice for a Roman prisoner. Paetus lacks the courage to commit, so Arria, the paragon of nobility that she is, plunges the knife into her own breast, uttering the words &#8220;See, Paetus, it does not hurt&#8221;. It is this final act that gripped me. This scene, rich in classicism with its profile poses, chiaroscuro, and stage-like setting, became the wellspring of inspiration for my musical reflection.\nThe composition begins with a descending half step in the violin, a motif that emerged as I imagined the dagger plunging into Arria‚Äôs chest. Consider this half step her last breath, the final gasp of air as the life leaves her lungs. The ensuing orchestration, which happens to be the most elaborate in the collection, features a brass quartet, adding depth and gravitas to reflect Arria&#8217;s noble sacrifice. \nStructurally, the piece unfolds in ternary form with a double introduction. The strings first establish the key, with diminished chords resolving into authentic cadences. Then, the horns introduce the initial melody, representing Arria&#8217;s nobility and stoic resolve. The strings then re-enter with a roiling two against three pattern, underscoring the highly turbulent scene contained on the canvas. The recapitulation revisits similar themes but in C minor, symbolizing the emotional shift in the narrative.\nAs you listen to this piece, I invite you to immerse yourself in Arria&#8217;s world, to feel the weight of her choice and the tragic beauty of her sacrifice. This composition is not merely a musical interpretation of a historical moment but a journey through a spectrum of human emotions, where courage meets tragedy in a careful dance. In each note and harmony, you&#8217;ll find a piece of my own wrestle with these forces, however I encourage you to search this music for your own sense of meaning. Let your heart be captured by the drama of this ancient tale, and contemplate the enduring, undaunted, and courageous nature of the human spirit.\nLink to the custom dropsite that I built:\nhttps://hereontour.xyz/\nLink to the detail page for this piece:\nhttps://hereontour.xyz/arria-and-paetus/\nLink to my notion workspace for the collection:\nhttps://artmusic-io.notion.site/artmusic-io/HERE-ON-TOUR-EXTERNAL-ad452c63a3ca4ce796b93f479c6e827b\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arria-and-Paetus-OpenGraph.png,1080,1080,1878704,1of1s,Manifold,https://app.manifold.xyz/c/arria-and-paetus-no2
10910,"The Evening Star, No. 1","When I first encountered Jean Baptiste Camille Corot‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Evening Star‚Äô at the Walters Art Museum, the muted tones and the tender optimism of a hand reaching towards a celestial light captivated me. This painting is a masterclass in subtle lyricism, typical of Corot‚Äôs style. It inspired me to compose a piece of music that echoes its gentle hopefulness, affirming that wishing upon a star can be more than a fanciful dream.\nEchoing ‚ÄòThe Golden Hour‚Äô theme within the exhibition, where scenes of sunset and twilight allowed artists to play with color and shade, my composition seeks to capture a similar sense of stillness and ease. The journey begins with the cello, which sets the stage with eight bars of arpeggiated pizzicato chords. This introduction, simple yet profound, paves the way for the main melody, a theme that speaks of aspirations and yearnings. As the bass assumes the role of the chordal accompaniment, the melody, akin to the light of the evening star, weaves through the piece, shifting from one instrument to another. This interchange not only provides dynamic contrast but also paints a rich tapestry of timbres, each adding its unique voice to the narrative. The composition concludes with a plagal cadence, a nod to the romantic era composers who often used it to evoke pastoral serenity, much like the tranquil scene Corot has painted here.\nAs you listen, I invite you to envision the painting coming to life off the canvas. Through the language of music ‚Äì the violin suspensions that hold you in anticipation, the rhythmic dance of the clarinet‚Äôs quarter-note triplets, and the trembling whispers of the viola‚Äôs tremolos ‚Äì I hope to give a voice to the central figure in the painting. I encourage you to find your own story within these notes, to let your imagination roam free under the spell of the evening star. In each chord, melody, and harmony, lies a piece of my journey, an invitation to explore the beauty that music and art can create together, and the belief that I carry deeply within my heart: the future is luminous.\nLink to the custom dropsite that I built:\nhttps://hereontour.xyz/\nLink to the detail page for this piece:\nhttps://hereontour.xyz/the-evening-star/\nLink to my notion workspace for the collection:\nhttps://artmusic-io.notion.site/artmusic-io/HERE-ON-TOUR-EXTERNAL-ad452c63a3ca4ce796b93f479c6e827b\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Evening-Star-OpenGraph.png,1080,1080,1731206,1of1s,Manifold,https://app.manifold.xyz/c/the-evening-star-no1

10842,AI Alchemy,"Detailed Description of the Artwork &#8220;AI Alchemy&#8221;.\nConcept:\n&#8220;AI Alchemy&#8221; is a digital art piece that explores the fusion of human creativity with the power of AI, symbolizing a journey of transformation, growth, and collective harmony. The artwork embodies the essence of crypto baroque, an artistic style that I have pioneered, representing a blend of traditional artistry with modern digital techniques.\nProcess:\nThe creative process for &#8220;AI Alchemy&#8221; is a meticulous composition of layers, each crafted using AI tools and Adobe Photoshop. The deep background layer features a digital collage portraying a horse with butterfly wings, symbolizing freedom and transformation. This surreal image sets the stage for the multi-layered narrative of the artwork.\nUsing AI tools like Dalle-3 and MidJourney 6.0, I created visual subliminals that resonate with themes of\noptimism,\ninterconnectedness,\ncompassion,\nexpansion,\nabundance,\nand transformation. I trained the MidJourney model on my own art, transforming pieces with these keywords to encapsulate their essence in new forms. In parallel, I employed Dalle-E to generate otherworldly landscapes imbued with subliminal messages of joy, optimism, abundance, and adventure.\nThe layering process involved a dynamic interplay of creation and destruction. In Photoshop, I transformed and erased parts of the deeper background layers, while the foreground layers featured small, intricate pieces of artwork created in MidJourney. Each piece, though small, carries the energy of the whole, harmonizing together like a symphony.\nThe piece has an AR dimension powered by Artivive, allowing to explore all the layers and to have a personalized experience with the piece. \nTools Used:\n‚Ä¢\tMidJourney 6.0: Employed to create visual subliminals and transform my own art using AI and keywords.\n‚Ä¢\tDalle-3: Utilized for generating imaginative landscapes and elements based on specific themes.\n‚Ä¢\tAdobe Photoshop: For digital collage creation, layer manipulation, and blending various elements.\n‚Ä¢\tArtivive App: For the AR dimension, providing an immersive, multi-layered experience. https://artivive.com/\nArtistic Philosophy:\nMy approach to creating art is akin to composing music. I continuously add and refine elements until the artwork resonates with the intended message and emotion. This process is documented in a video available on Google Drive, showcasing the layers of creating &#8220;AI Alchemy.&#8221;\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QaEWG9uZOIogBviqBlqaRlohmSVEs_zX?usp=sharing\nLeading Questions:\nThe creation of this piece was driven by profound questions about the role of AI in shaping human consciousness and future:\n‚Ä¢\tCan AI be utilized as a tool to reprogram humanity?\n‚Ä¢\tHow can AI-generated images activate a deep transformation within us?\n‚Ä¢\tIs it possible to enhance humanity&#8217;s core values by directly engaging our subconscious minds?\n‚Ä¢\tCan we, collectively with AI, craft a more harmonious and prosperous future?\n&#8220;AI Alchemy&#8221; is a philosophical inquiry and a testament to the potential of AI in expanding the boundaries of human creativity and consciousness.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AI-Alchemy-by-Eka.jpg,2000,2000,7778253,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/optimism/0x9d8c9105128243fbe09e10b69b230162504b9996/1

It helped to popularize photography and photo portraits on a proportional scale similar to the advent of smartphones. The process involves pouring collodion (a syrupy solution of nitrocellulose in a mixture of alcohol and ether) on a black metal (or glass) plate that is then made light sensitive with a solution of silver salts. While still wet, the plate is placed into the camera using a film holder and the exposure is made, after which it is processed using chemistry to reveal the latent negative image and then fixed into a positive image.\nAll images in the collection were made using cameras and lenses from late 1870ies.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MEMENTO-REFLECTED-VANITIES_150dpi_010.jpg,1500,844,837289,1of1s,Manifold,https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xf3a9a3925e7260ed37e2fe09c490fa98365d18dd/10

10762,My Mountain of Clothes,"This is a 1of1 from a collection of illustrations i (bea, 15y/o) have been drawing on procreate (on my iPad), with an apple pen, for my moms childrens book. she has been writing about my life growing up and asked me to illustrate the book, so I asked my mom to write the description for this, because i&#8217;m not as good at explaining the book as she is. but all the proceeds from minting will go towards publishing our book. and whoever decides to mint will get a free signed copy sent to wherever they are in the world, once it&#8217;s published! here&#8217;s what my mom wrote about our story and journey together:\nAs a mother of five, I thought I understood children better than most. When my children come to me with questions or concerns, it is up to me to guide them with firmness and wisdom. If they understand their boundaries, they will feel secure‚Ä¶Or so I thought‚Ä¶ When my fifth child, almost two years old, declared he was a boy (he could barely string a complete sentence together mind you), I thought, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre just confused. You have a vagina and that makes you a girl.‚Äù He would look down, dejected but eventually persist each day. His siblings often informed me, again and again, ‚ÄúBea‚Äôs a boy, mom, he really is!‚Äù He would only wear boy‚Äôs underwear (which he stole from our friend‚Äôs homes whenever he could), and never wore anything ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. Always peed facing the toilet. Always stomping through the house grabbing his crotch. It got to the point where anytime we went to my sister‚Äôs house, who has two sons, he would ransack their dressers and closets literally trying on anything he could get his hands on and wouldn‚Äôt leave without borrowing some version of hulk t-shirts and cargo pants, a heap of clothing in his wake. As I observed all of this, I became more and more puzzled. The more I tried to clarify and explain, the more withdrawn and ashamed Bea became. Sometimes he would just cry for no reason. But it wasn‚Äôt an ordinary ‚ÄúI want my way‚Äù cry. It was deep sobbing from somewhere very fragile and real. If forced to wear a dress, he would hide if he saw anyone he knew and genuinely looked mortified. I knew for certain that Bea was not just a tomboy. I had known many tomboys, even considered my younger self to be one. Reflecting back on Bea‚Äôs infancy, holding him in my arms, I remember feeling like the pronoun ‚Äúshe‚Äù just didn‚Äôt seem correct. It felt forced and unnatural. Even though he was dressed in pink onesies and purple fur boots, I used to think, ‚Äúhm, how odd‚Ä¶she really feels like a boy‚Äù. It was in the subtle gestures. The way he moved his body, running, climbing, even laughing. He moved like my older son. His energy was not like any girl‚Äôs I had ever known. At this point I‚Äôd already had three girls and a boy. Each of them, whether princesses or pirates, felt comfortably slotted into the male and female categories. But this child was different. If I‚Äôd listened to my instinct when Bea was born, I would have known his truth much sooner than I did. I could have saved him so much pain if I‚Äôd been on his side earlier. I don‚Äôt think I have to explain what it would be like to feel your entire being is somehow wrong or bad. To feel alone in the world. He experienced all of this by the time he was in kindergarten. I didn‚Äôt know how to help him. Im ashamed to say I had never even heard the word ‚Äútransgender‚Äù until my friend gave me a book about identifying and raising trans kids. It was a foreign new world I never imagined. And I had considered myself pretty open minded compared to others. I worried, if I could barely grasp the idea of what gender means, how will anyone else get it? I was afraid and sad for my child, imagining that the rest of the world would never understand much less accept him. But instead, something magical happened. Once I started to be supportive Bea started to flourish. The first time I let him pick out his own ‚Äúboy‚Äù clothes, I had never seen such a light shine in him. He was literally beaming, his insanely cute dimples deeply accentuating his joy. I was inspired to write a simple story about Bea, from his journey across the rainbow bridge to becoming the boy he always told us he was. I wanted it to be lighthearted and easily understandable, from the perspective of a child. The world as Bea sees it is full of wonder and playfulness, and lots of wardrobe changes. It is optimistic and beautiful. The message of this story is a universal one: that everyone‚Äôs true self should be celebrated. When he was 13 years old, I asked him to illustrate his story and, I‚Äôm not exaggerating, the characters and illustrations are just how I imagined them in my head. Bea has been an extraordinary gift to me and to the world, nudging me to open my eyes and heart. To have courage. After all, some of us take a lifetime to figure out who we really are. When Bea slides down the rainbow bridge, we all feel the thrill and promise of a life soon to unfold. Like Bea in his many ‚Äúoutfits‚Äù, we try on many identities through our lives and in this story. Life is an adventure. And it‚Äôs all okay.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0344.png,1620,2160,5770037,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x6ec474134c91d90c459d059edd6e600d15e7af35/premint-1

10680,NON-AGITATIONISM,"&#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; is a meditation in motion, a visual symphony that echoes the steady yet complex rhythm of a heart at rest. It&#8217;s an artwork where light and color are not mere accents but the essence of its narrative, tracing the intricate dance of our innermost pulses.\nThe piece uses light not just to illuminate but to reveal the sophistication of life&#8217;s core beat. Colors transition smoothly, their gradients highlighting the nuanced cadences of a heartbeat, each shift a whisper of life&#8217;s rich tapestry.\nIn this creation, I invite viewers to pause, to breathe, to sync with the artwork&#8217;s gentle rhythm. It&#8217;s a digital reflection of our heartbeat, a reminder of the quiet yet powerful life force within us all. Here, meditation transcends silence, becoming a luminous journey through the layers of our being.\nIn creating &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat,&#8221; I found myself drawn into the emotional depths of Mark Rothko&#8217;s canvases, the surreal landscapes of Dreamcore, and the perpetual motion intrinsic to Kinetic Art.\nRothko&#8217;s work taught me the power of colors to evoke feeling, and in my piece, I sought to channel that same raw emotion through gradients and glow, inviting viewers to experience a heartbeat&#8217;s intimate rhythm.\nThe peculiar, dreamlike quality of Dreamcore subtly infused my work with its pink hues and translucent oddities, lending it an otherworldly charm that blurs the lines between the strange and the familiar, the real and the imagined.\nAnd from Kinetic Art, I embraced the essence of movement. Each digital strand in &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; seems to breathe and sway, engaging viewers in a silent conversation about our place in a world where technology and organic life are increasingly intertwined.\nThis artwork is a personal narrative, a piece of my soul rendered in digital form. It stands as a reflection of life&#8217;s pulsations, a heartbeat within the binary beat of our time.\nThe creation of &#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; began with a simple sphere in MODO, symbolizing potential and the start of life&#8217;s rhythm. This sphere, the artwork‚Äôs core, was soon layered with fur, giving it a lifelike texture. Two types of fur were used: one thick and protective, the other fine and floating, creating a contrast that added depth and movement.\nThe material of the sphere itself was refined to have a reflective and translucent quality, resembling a living membrane. This allowed the sphere to interact with its environment, reflecting and absorbing light, giving it a subtle inner glow.\nColor in this piece arose from the play of light, the sphere‚Äôs surface, and its innate luminosity, yielding a palette that‚Äôs rich and complex. The final colors, complex due to the translucency, add to the piece‚Äôs organic feel.\n&#8220;Ethereal Heartbeat&#8221; is a digital sculpture that seems to pulse with life. It is a visual echo of the rhythms that sustain us, capturing the essence of a heartbeat within a delicate, living membrane.\n",null,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0xdfd5ee29276cd57535a826cdcced31bce7d34a41/1

10661,BINARY COSMOS,"&#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; embodies the &#8216;Dance of Chaos and Order,&#8217; reflecting the ever-shifting balance between stability and unpredictability in the cosmos and digital world. The moving binary digits represent the unpredictable nature of digital data against the orderly backdrop of the universe, highlighting the contrast between the structured cycles of celestial bodies and the randomness of the digital realm.\nThe artwork also transforms into a space for digital meditation. The zeroes and ones, swirling in their harmonious yet unpredictable patterns, invite viewers into a contemplative state, echoing the immersive experience of our digital lives. This modern meditation, set amidst a galaxy of binary code, offers a tranquil escape, moving away from traditional settings to the heart of the digital realm. &#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; becomes a nexus of peace and introspection, merging the digital with the spiritual for a unique, reflective experience.\nAs the creator of &#8220;Binary Cosmos: The Dance of Zeroes and Ones,&#8221; my journey through the realms of digital art has been deeply influenced by a blend of artistic movements and visionary artists. The conceptual depth of Sol LeWitt, who championed the idea over the physical form, resonates with my approach to art. In &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; I sought to transcend the visual, using binary code not just as a medium, but as a metaphor for our digitized existence, echoing LeWitt&#8217;s emphasis on concept.\nThe kinetic energy and movement within my work draw inspiration from the dynamism of Kinetic Art, where each animated binary digit mirrors the fluidity of the digital age. This movement is a dialogue with the viewer, reflecting the ever-changing nature of data and technology, much like the living sculptures of Kinetic Art. Additionally, the influence of Pop Art, particularly the mass-production techniques of Andy Warhol, is evident in the creation process. Utilizing modern 3D software, I replicated the binary elements across the spherical canvas, akin to Warhol&#8217;s silkscreen printing, but in the digital realm. The vibrant color scheme, reminiscent of Pop Art&#8217;s playful aesthetic, bridges the gap between the viewer&#8217;s everyday digital interactions and the art, making &#8220;Binary Cosmos&#8221; not just a visual experience but a culturally relevant piece.\nIn creating &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; I aimed to capture the essence of these artistic movements, intertwining them with the innovative spirit of Thomas Heatherwick&#8217;s Seed Cathedral. The artwork is a reflection of the complexities and nuances of the digital world, a space where conceptual depth, kinetic energy, and pop culture converge, creating a unique narrative about the relationship between humanity and the ever-evolving digital landscape.\nIn the creation of &#8220;Binary Cosmos,&#8221; the artist initiated with a simple ball in MODO, a 3D software, shaping it into a globe upon which binary codes would perform their virtual dance. This sphere symbolized unity and set the stage for the unfolding digital narrative.\nIn a move that highlights the innovative spirit of the artist, the original ball and the two binary shapes were then hidden, allowing the replicated digits to stand on their own, populating the spherical space with their presence. This act of concealment is emblematic of the crypto art narrative, where the underlying structure is just as important as the visible outcome.\nThe creative process embraced randomness within set boundaries, a dance between artist control and digital serendipity. Defined coordinates and rotations granted each binary figure a distinct identity, yet their final arrangement and interaction were left to chance, reflecting the cosmic interplay of order and chaos.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo_2024-01-07-10.14.12.jpeg,1280,1264,101422,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x53d0798c0aa32d607eaed93a5f27c716614d4fa7/2

10470,DAO Triptychs,"DAO Triptychs are a series of 150 generative NFTs on Optimism. The triptychs generate derivations from a set of 23 pencil and ink drawings that I made over the course of 2023. Each of these drawings represent an archetypal activity, meme or ideology I&#8217;ve noticed from working and building in DAOs . Subjects include ideas like &#8220;Governance,&#8221; &#8220;Distribution,&#8221; &#8220;Collaboration,&#8221; &#8220;Moloch,&#8221; etc. \nTo create the generative NFTs, I wrote python scripts that manage randomized, weighted placements of the drawings in the format of classical triptychs. Like an altarpiece, this allows a braiding of concepts from the series to become a singular reflective statement. In addition, the scripts manage randomized colors, various layer blends, text, the overlay of interference patterns and drawn marginalia to enhance their aesthetics and meaning.\nMy hope is that these works, formatted as banners, can allow their holders to affiliate and reflect upon a particular vocation or aspect of DAOs. In addition, they may become a lasting, on-chain memory of this particular moment in the advancement of DAO themes and practices. I feel ideas such as those in the Triptychs are going to be a lasting element of how humans (and possibly digital agents) organize themselves, build and advance culture in the coming era.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/preview2.gif,null,null,null,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x6d21e5ed187958cab32d183efa5e555092348891

This exoplanet is located in the outermost regions of the universe and has drawn the attention of astronomers and astrobiologists due to its stunning and vivid scenery. The planet&#8217;s landscape is a symphony of colors, which produces an extraordinary spectacle that defies the traditional notions of planetary environments.\nThe Idea:\nThe goal is to establish a metaverse that links different collections and their respective lore. I will be periodically sharing the backstory of each collection, and once the backstory is complete, users will be given questions that will impact how the lore evolves. It&#8217;s similar to a large-scale version of Dungeons and Dragons.\nThe process behind:\nI am creating art by using self-trained models on top of Stable Diffusion. It required many iterations to generate these NFTs. Out of every 15 generated pieces, only one was quite successful. I retrained the models on successful pieces to create a cleaner and more similar collection. \nAnd also to generate the traits and lore, I am using Chat GPT.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Monster40.jpg,1536,1536,586107,1of1s,"OpenSea,Stability AI",https://opensea.io/collection/ethereal-menace-genesis-of-the-goo-guardians/overview

10363,Algorithmic Semiosis,"For a comprehensive overview of the project, with images and media content, please visit this link https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/beyond-the-code%3A-algorithmic-semiosis-and-the-construction-of-meaning\nSYNOPSIS\nThe interactive generative project Algorithmic Semiosis* is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of meaning, examining the idea that meaning does not exist in itself, but is created through human interpretation.\n&#8212;&#8211;&#8220;It is precisely facts that do not exist, only interpretations.&#8221; ‚Äî Friedrich Nietzsche&#8212;&#8211;\nThe artwork&#8217;s typographic chaos mirrors the contemporary human reality, where possibilities and potential meanings get lost in the streams of informational noise, making their autonomous discovery incredibly challenging. An algorithm assists the viewer in identifying units of meaning expressed in words by highlighting them with a hint frame; however, the interpretation of these units is entirely dependent on the viewer.\nThe set of words-meanings is not static and changes at specified time intervals. The interval of change is individual for each piece, as is the individual time required for each person to comprehend the manifested meanings: for some, it may be an instant, for others &#8211; a day or a week, and for still others, even eternity may not suffice.\nDespite changing sets of words, the artwork remains deterministic; its distinctive features, such as composition, principles of typographic field formation, chosen color palette, and font selection, remain constant.\n*Semiosis is the process of creating and interpreting meaning.\nMEANING SEARCH METHODOLOGY\n &#8211; Open the edition, wait for the loading to complete, and for the first hint frame to appear;\n &#8211; Reflect on the associations that arise in connection with the appeared word;\n &#8211; Invoke the next frame by double-clicking on the canvas;\n &#8211; Consider the images evoked by the combination of the previous and current words;\n &#8211; Continue exploring (by double-clicking) and interpreting meanings.\nART&#8217;S HISTORICAL FABRIC\nThe artwork Algorithmic Semiosis references the craft collage style of Picasso and Braque, in which various textures, such as fragments of newspaper clippings and pieces of wrapping paper, are incorporated into the painted canvas. The digital painting in the project similarly retains these forms, but within a new space and medium, giving rise to a visual paradox and offering the viewer new ways of interpreting reality.\nThe newspaper column style, employed as the foundation of each canvas, underscores the theme of words and meanings, paying homage to Gutenberg and his invention, which revolutionarily impacted the speed of emergence and dissemination of new meanings.\nThe frame, as a tool for detecting hidden messages, is also an artistic continuation of the thematic exploration. It is stylized as a newspaper clipping with torn paper edges and characteristic text filling. However, upon closer inspection, instead of text, one can discern ASCII characters, serving as a reference to the postmodernist notion of the blurring boundaries between humans and machines, between reality and simulation.\nINTERACTIVE STRUCTURE OF EACH PIECE AND MEANING GENERATION\nEach artwork of the collection is a dynamic interactive piece, based on a code-generated abstract breathing lettering canvas with an encrypted set of words, serving as units of meaning.\nThe viewer&#8217;s engagement with the artwork begins with the appearance of the first word within the frame. The viewer interprets it in the context of their subjective experience and shapes their own meaning. Double-clicks on the canvas activate a new frame, revealing new words and eliciting fresh associative images from the viewer.\nThe number of words in each output is not fixed and can vary from one to several. The interval for changing the set of words is individual for each artwork, ranging from a day to a month, and is specified in the piece&#8217;s traits. Pressing the &#8216;t&#8217; key activates a countdown timer, indicating when a new set of words ‚Äî and therefore, new meanings ‚Äî will be available.\nDespite changes in the linguistic structure of the artwork, the piece itself remains deterministic; the visual components and formative characteristics remain constant and unique to each work in the series.\nCONTROLS\n &#8211; Double-click on the canvas to hide or reveal hint frames.\n &#8211; Press &#8216;t&#8217; to display/hide the countdown timer on the screen.\n &#8211; Press &#8216;s&#8217; to save the PNG image of the current view.\n &#8211; Press &#8216;2&#8217; to &#8216;7&#8217; to rerender the output in various resolutions from lower to higher.\n &#8211; Click and drag the frame to move it.\n¬© Collaborative generative art project by @CartonCarroll &amp; @m5alien, January 03, 2024, made with p5.js.\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Algorithmic-Semiosis.jpg,1000,1000,367258,1of1s,Highlight,https://highlight.xyz/mint/6594407b66d1a3855c932922

10347,First NFT coursework as an Art,"The first time you start the program, you need to log in from the Main admin account to add new accounts. Then we are greeted by 3 windows: work with accounts, work with employees and exit. \nWorking with accounts. Here we create an account for our employee, give him login, password and access rights, which are of 3 types: user, admin, Main admin. If we enter the application with user access rights, we can view information about ourselves only. Admin gives rights to view information about yourself and user accounts, as well as edit any user: change login, password. And Main admin can edit any rights, login and password of any users.\nThe NFT video shows how I created a new account with Optimism login, gave it Rollup password and admin rights. Then I changed the password to WeLoveTheArt and changed the permissions to user. Then I saved the changes and got a notification about it.\nWork with Employees. This is where all employees and their sick leave payments are recorded. Below I will describe most of the functions of the program.\n1) Add Employee. With this function you add a new employee to the database. But before entering his/her details, you are prompted to create/bind an account or you can do it later. Binding to an account is done thanks to the ID, which is automatically assigned to each even-numbered record when it is created.\nNext, you enter the employee&#8217;s full name, age, gender, title and salary for the position. The employee is then added to the database\n2) View Employees. This is where you can view employees who have accounts lower in rank (for example, if you are Main admin, you can view everyone, if admin, you can view only users, and if user, you can view only yourself). Anyone with an account equal to or above your rank will be hidden.\nNext, you can sort all employees by last name, position, fines for the month, payments for the month and by ID\n3) Search Employee. You can find an employee by full name, ID or position. In the video example, we will search for an employee by position.\nWhen an employee is found, the following options appear:\nA) view detailed information about the employee. Full name, gender, age, current position, salary without and with fines and rewards. And also information about the user account: login, password, rights and ID.\nThen you can see a table with the number of sick days, vacation days, absent days of the employee, which are recorded as fines. And overtime days, number of bonuses and total bonuses for the month.\nAll this information is recorded in a visualized calendar that we can navigate through and see the employee&#8217;s fines and rewards for previous months.\nB) Edit Employee. This is where you can change the employee&#8217;s name, gender, and age.\nC) Change the employee&#8217;s position. You can add a new position, modify existing ones, or delete the last one.\nD) Rewards and Fines. Here you can add/modify/delete rewards and fines for previous dates up to the current day. All this is recorded in the calendar and this will be available to know about the employee in A)\n4) Learn about yourself. This is where you can learn about yourself as an employee. Your fines and awards and other information that can be found out in point A). &#8220;Learn about yourself&#8221; is made for convenience so that you don&#8217;t have to search for a long time for the information you need.\n5) Change coefficients. This function is available only to Main admins. It allows you to change the pay coefficients, which are used to calculate your salary for the month, taking into account penalties and awards. For example, if you have worked overtime for 1 day, your pay for this day will be 1.5 times higher than for a regular day. But this can be changed and the coefficient can be increased to 2x\nThe last function is logout. After logging out of the program, you can either remember the account and then you will not need to log in again, or forget the account and then you will need to enter the login and password again.\nBy default, the program saves the authorization. This is for convenience, but you can always unlogin before logging out if you want to do so.\nThus, I captured my first NFT coursework in C++. I wonder if anyone has ever done this? I showed most of what my program can do. \nI&#8217;m incredibly pleased with the fact that I did such an extensive piece of work in just a month, having studied programming for less than a year.\nI used the most basic C++ libraries, the most complex of which are , , and .\nAnd of course the calendar, with the ability to add events, is my pride.\nIf anyone has read this long story &#8211; thank you very much:)\n",https://welovetheart.optimism.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0454.png,4581,6513,1622272,1of1s,Zora,https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xb1fd8c509e28734e4a01d4509525d4e85a668924/1
